## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why focus on Japan when they're only 14 reviews?**
A: Premium segment (100€ avg check), growing market (5%), B2B dominated (easy to scale via tour operators), first-mover advantage, national tourism support.

**Q: What if we don't have 6,000€ budget?**
A: Start with Phase 1 (3,000€), evaluate after 6 months, expand if successful. Minimum: TripAdvisor optimization (500€) = 54-66x ROI.

**Q: How long until we see results?**
A: TripAdvisor optimization: 2-3 months. Tour operator partnerships: 8-12 months (booking lead time). Full ROI: 18-24 months.

**Q: Is it worth it for just 300-350 guests/year?**
A: Yes. 300 guests × 110€ = 33,000€ revenue. High margins, advance bookings, premium positioning, repeat customers.

**Q: What if our service isn't good enough?**
A: FIX SERVICE FIRST before marketing. Train staff in omotenashi, improve timing/quality, THEN promote to Japanese market.

**Q: Can we skip tour operators and focus on individual travelers?**
A: Not recommended. 93% of Japanese tourists use tour operators. Individual travelers = only 7% of market. Must do B2B.

**Q: What about Tabelog listing?**
A: Difficult for foreign restaurants, but try. Focus on TripAdvisor Japan first (easier, faster), Tabelog as long-term experiment.

**Q: Do we need Japanese-speaking staff?**
A: No, but photo menu is ESSENTIAL. Basic phrases help. Professional service attitude more important than language.
