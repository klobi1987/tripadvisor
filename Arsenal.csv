Breathtaking views to eat your dinner, the food was really lovely, couldn’t fault at all. I had a couple of glasses of Prosecco, and they gave me the second one on the house.

Baggio1018,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,"We ate on two occasions here, once for a light meal and another for a full dinner.

One thing to note first, if you have the Dubrovnik pass, mention it to get 10% off the bill.

The restaurant is right by the harbour, so if you are looking for the classic sunset view, get there early on for a balcony table (you may still need to wait). We were lucky and got a table, although as it had just rained on the day, it was awfully chilly (but the restaurant is prepared with small blankets for you to wrap up in).
Cannot fault the service, the staff were patient in explaining the menu and provided good service.

The food, hmmm, this is where it is not consistent, so some work is needed.
The bread basket is nice and varied, the grilled squid is also decent quality, but the fish soup was bland and plain (with very little fish in it).

The second time we visited, we ordered a fish stew and the grilled squid again. The fish stew was nice, would recommend.

All in all, a decent restaurant in a good location. Prices are typical of Dubrovnik Old Town so just be prepared for that.",,Sep 2025

S A D,"Chipping Campden, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,3,null,null,null,null,"Even though we had specifically visited earlier to book our table for 20:30 we were greeted by a very stoney faced, slightly condescending waitress who couldn’t find our booking and she went off to talk to all the other waiting staff to see if we had truly done this ! Eventually we were led to a table … so maybe someone had remembered us. 

The Dubrovnik Food Festival is on and there was a Set Menu on the table with two options - a Meat option and a Fish Option. In addition to the usual menu. 

We opted for the Special menu. 

The fish starter (strangely included meat so not suitable for a Pescatarian) was delicious. Fine slices of tuna, capers, veal pate and fresh basil. 

The main course was the blandest beige-est plate of food. Fish, cauliflower puree - so boring. Desperately needed some spice, some flavour or some green vegetables. 

Final course was a take on the chocolate Raffello and was interesting. 

The staff were attentive but not friendly. The view was lovely. 

The smell from the neighbouring diner’s heavy tobacco habit was not good. Although technically we were “outside” so we had to put up with it. 

Tonight we are going to try a more intimate restaurant … of which there are plenty here thankfully. 

Three stars is probably too generous.",,Oct 2025

Travellingdoc,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,null,null,null,null,"Located by the old port area of Dubrovnik, this restaurant sits beautifully under the stone arches overlooking the small harbour — a lovely spot with great views. It’s part of the same group that runs other well-known places like Panorama, Dubravka 1836, and the fine-dining restaurant Nautika.

We hadn’t made a booking but managed to get a table in the second row facing out through the arches. The setting was charming and ideal for a relaxed lunch or early dinner.

We started with a glass of white wine and some bread. The bread selection (€3) included three different types — reasonable but nothing special, and we didn’t end up eating much of it. Prices overall were on the higher side, even by European standards.

For the main course, I had the cuttlefish on a bed of potato purée with a squid ink sauce. This dish was excellent — perfectly cooked with a tender interior and crispy exterior, and the black squid sauce added great flavour, though I wish there had been a bit more of it.

Service was friendly and professional. Our waitress, Draga, and the hostess, Maya, were both helpful 
, and I particularly appreciated that they offered a small tasting before ordering a glass of wine — a nice touch.

Overall, Gradska Kavana Arsenal offers a beautiful setting and solid food, with standout seafood and good service, though prices are a bit above average for what you get.",,Oct 2025

RK502,"Palm Springs, California",USA,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"This was our first trip to Dubrovnik and it was my responsibility to book a restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday. What a daunting task considering all the amazing dining options in such a magical city. After whittling it down to a dozen or so options, the coin flip(s) finally favored Gradska Kavana Arsenal and I made an on-line reservation. When we arrived in the city, I dropped in early into the restaurant and spoke with the hostess and asked whether she could reserve a prime table for the special occasion. She assured me that she would do so.
When we arrived later in the evening, we indeed had a prime table along the waterfront. Now the atmosphere was excellent, how would the rest of the evening turn out.....and it started with a very friendly and most efficient water. His service along with other wait staff was excellent. And the food.....from appetizers to entrees to the wine.....equal to the views and the service. All combined for an incredibly memorable evening in an incredible city!",,Sep 2025

We sat next to a pianist and saxophonist, sipping on a refreshing Hugo Spritz before dinner.

After about ten minutes (much quicker than expected), we were seated. Our waiter came over right away to take our drinks order, and the service throughout the evening was impeccable. The food was absolutely delicious. I still have no idea how they make the chicken so tender and full of flavour!

We had a lovely view of the harbor from our table, though if you’d like to sit right by the water, I’d recommend booking in advance. Overall, a wonderful evening. I’d love to come back!",,Jun 2025

ROBERT M,null,null,4,null,null,null,null,"We met our son and his young family, who live in Europe, for a 10-day holiday. Dubrovnik offered lots of activities - exploring the city, short cruises, beach excursions to islands by ferry and right by the city walls. The weather was wonderful in September and the seafood was amazing.

Some suggestions: pack light, there are endless stairs and no transport in the walled city. If you take a tour make sure there’s adequate time at the destination. Our day trip to Mostar and the Kravice Falls was a big disappointment with 7 hours on the bus and little time at either destination. 

We enjoyed the trip but if we did it again, we would make our base a less touristic town and go to Dubrovnik for a night or two.",,Sep 2025
MisterHonesty12,null,null,4,null,null,null,null,"Having twice been thwarted in booking this place pre-trip, we chanced our collective arm on passing on a Saturday night and waddayaknow, they had a table. The conditional 40 minute wait in the lovely lounge barely lasted 10 minutes, enough time for us to get two G&Ts started. And then to the table overlooking the magical little harbour in Old Town. 

Service was prompt, indeed the bread, oil and olives were barely down before mains arrived - not to worry, there's worse things in life. Fillet for her, ribeye for me. Mine came with a pot of new potatoes covered in a cheese sauce. Hers was accompanied by mushrooms which is the only food I dislike (not too keen on semolina either...). 

It was more satisfying than spectacular, but I have no gripes. The price was what you might expect for that location but I thought it was fair for what we had.

I probably wouldn't rush back but that's less about this restaurant and more about the proliferation of fantastic alternatives.",,Sep 2025

Original review:
Exceptionally poor service and facilities despite good food and lovely location We arrived for a pre-booked dinner at this restaurant which had been highly recommended by friends and colleagues. We were really excited as this was to be the highlight of our culinary experience of Dubrovnik.
On arriving we were directed by the bar staff through to the restaurant. We proceeded to the waiting sign... and we waited.... and we waited....
Whilst numerous staff of varying seniority walked past us and completely ignored us.
We stopped a member of staff saying we had a reservation…we were essentially ignored and continued to wait until eventually somebody said that they would check if our table was ready.
We were approached by the hostess who asked us to wait before we were finally shown to our table.
After being provided with menus we again...sat waiting....we were not acknowledged or
approached. At this point we were about to leave. It had become evident that the service was extremely poor and was ruining our experience. As we were about to leave we were finally approached for our order and decided to remain.
The waiter thereafter provided a good level of service.

It should be acknowledged that the food was excellent, the venue was beautiful (apart from the ladies facilities that were very substandard for a high end restaurant and more akin to a holiday camp) and that we had a great position near to the
sed.
The low score is based on the poor service, which ruined our experience prompting us to leave as soon as possible. Noting that we have had an amazing holiday in Dubrovnik and experienced fantastic food, wine and service throughout our time here. This restaurant has unfortunately been the exception.",,Aug 2025

Renata T,"Zagreb, Croatia",Croatia,2,5.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,"For my dear friend, Dubrovnik is more than just a destination — it is a second home. For over 30 years she has returned, in summer and winter alike, sometimes even more than twice a year. And for just as long, Gradska Kavana Arsenal has been a part of that tradition. Breakfasts, lunches, coffees with cake — they were moments she looked forward to, cherished, and shared with friends. For me too, in the last ten years, visiting Gradska Kavana has been almost a ritual, a guarantee of good service and warm memories.

That is why what happened yesterday hurt so deeply.

We sat on the terrace, enjoying a sunny Sunday morning. We ordered breakfast, coffee, and a double coffee, and felt the familiar comfort of being in a place we had trusted for years. The terrace was busy, full of people, but no one was waiting for a table. When we finished, we politely asked for the bill, paid it, and even added a tip of more than 20%. We were just about to leave — I had gone to the restroom — when a waiter approached my friend and asked her to hurry up and clear the table.

In that moment, it felt like all those years of loyalty and respect counted for nothing. Around us, other guests who had sat longer remained undisturbed. Yet my friend — someone who has given her time, her love, and her loyalty to this city and to Gradska Kavana for three decades — was singled out and asked to leave as if she were unwelcome. She was genuinely hurt, and so was I.

Dear Gradska Kavana Arsenal, this is not how you treat your guests. After so many years of loyalty, both at this location and at others under your brand in Dubrovnik, being asked to leave in such a manner feels disrespectful. Hospitality is not only about serving food and drinks — it is about respect, gratitude, and valuing the people who return to you again and again. Yesterday, you failed us. It leaves not only a bitter taste but also creates a poor image of Croatian tourism in this otherwise amazing city.

After so many beautiful memories in this place, it is not easy to write these words. And it is a sad reminder that true hospitality is fragile — and must never be taken for granted.",,Aug 2025

They nail the classical taste profile with an elegant and modern twist as they serve it with burrata and sage. It was so balanced and soooo tasty.

The restaurant holds itself out as high end albeit we felt the servers sort of rush and are not so genuine, probably due to size and business. It is also on the pricier side.

Patty B,"Nashville, Tennessee",USA,3,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,"We had two meals at Gradska Kavana Arsenal. Lunch one afternoon was wonderful. The location is great right on the water with lots of activity of boats coming and going.
We were walking by and didn't realize this was Gradska Kavana. We had dinner reservations the next night but were happy to stop for lunch. Besides,, it is rated as a top restaurant in Dubrovnik. 

 Drinks were refreshing and good, a pina colada for me a Corona for my husband.. We each had spaghetti with marinara sauce, it was good, nothing special. Portions weren't that large and 2 pastas, a beer, water and a cocktail were $78.00 US without tip. We thought the setting and atmosphere made up for any shortcomings with the food.

Dinner the next night was a total failure. We were seated inside but still had a nice view of the water. The place had no vibe or energy and was practically empty. There was piano player and singer in the back corner, they weren't good at all. Drinks were OK, and the burrata was not bad. The chicken entrees however were awful. Unfortunately, we both had the same thing as the other offerings were not appealing. The chicken was rolled and looked like sausages. It was served with some broccoli. The whole dish was bland and tasteless. Service wasn't great either. We were supremely disappointed and sorry we went.

 Over $100.00 US for tasteless, bland food..not good. This is not one of the best restaurants in Dubrovnik tha'ts for certain. Atmosphere sitting near the water at lunch OK. Dinner NO.",,Apr 2025

I wasn’t going to say anything as couldn’t be bothered but the waiter was clearly good at his job and noticed, so kindly took my eggs off the bill (which I didn’t expect or ask for).

We should have spent more time looking at the menu, of the 6 pages, 5 are taken up by drinks. The food selection covers breakfast, lunch and dinner, leaving only 6 options for main meals. I ordered the beef fillet, asking if the potato could be fries. The steak was of a good size and well cooked and the fries had the skin on and were very tasty. Accompanying the dish were three small dishes containing, ketchup, mayonnaise and a mushroom sauce, and that was it. No mushrooms or garnish. My mistake in not ordering a side but in a good restaurant I would have been prompted. At the second attempt to order desert the cheese cake was just that. Now the same dish at the sister restaurant (The Panarama near the cable car) had raspberry sauce, redcurrents and a grated nut garnish.

Our hotel (the Excelsior) arranged our first reservation and we had a wonderful table directly overlooking the harbour (which we booked again for our second visit).

During our two visits we enjoyed starters of Dalmation smoked ham and Burrata with a salad of rocket and pesto For mains we had the black risotto with cuttlefish and sage, and the chicken stuffed with feta cheese with gratin potatoes and broccoflower. on our second visit we were presented with complimentary deserts due to being return guests. All of the food was very tasty and well presented. We chose wines by the glass which were very good.

The restaurant was a pearl to the eye despite the fact that when we went to eat there was a heavy storm over old Dubrovnik. We initially sat on the terrace but since the wind was stronger and we got wet we were kindly offered to take a seat inside to continue enjoying our meal and evening. 
The food was typical Croatian from starter to main course to dessert and was really worth its price quality despite not expecting this given the framework you are in and this compared to other things within the city walls.

Great quality food. I ate a black risotto (cuttlefish ink risotto) on the menu of all the restaurants in the Croatian town and I can say, without a doubt, that it was the best risotto tasted in town. 
Fair price for what is the standard of Dubrovnik given the quality and location where this restaurant is located.

Our staff were very attentive and were great at giving recommendations, both for food and for activities around Dubrovnik. We really enjoyed our starters. I opted for the Burrata which was especially refreshing, flavoursome and well plated. My partner chose the beef carpaccio, which was tender and delicious. I also loved the desserts here, especially the decadent chocolate mousse and crème caramel. There is only one thing I would fault about this place. My sea bass main was quite a let down. I love sea bass but truly feel that this main lacked flavour. It came in baking parchment paper surrounded by water that was also not flavourful. This left me feeling dissatisfied, but the lovely dessert brought my spirits back up. We really did have a great time here and I would definitely come back! I’d just order something else for main.

The food is of good quality: the vegetables were fresh, the cuttlefish tasty, the risotto tasty but unfortunately suffers from the habit (I think recent) of flavoring with cheese (in this case a little pecorino was used; in the original recipe instead I think it used only mascarpone), the rozata turned out to be a delicious orange pudding.

Our online booking was rejected due to being “full” but we walked past and the place was almost empty so we got a table right on the harbour. 

I ordered eggs royale and was hugely disappointed to be served overcooked eggs with hard yolks, which really spoilt the dish. 

Breakfast dishes are served with a bread/pastries basket which is nice touch and could have been great. However the basket is served between two and contained an odd number of items making it impossible to share fairly (3 mini bread rolls between two). The conserves were the best thing but the chocolate spread was poor quality. 

The service was slow and I had to repeatedly ask for milk. By the time the third person asked for bring some (which took a long time) my tea was already cold.

Florchin,null,null,1,null,null,null,null,"We went for dinner with my family to this restaurant as it was recommended by other friends that came by. I was really surprised about the quality of the whole dinner taking into account the prices we were paying. 
I had a steak that came in a huge cold plate dry as a shoe sole, with cold mash and a very little of a cold sauce it didn’t have any flavors. My mum had the chicken with polenta and puttanesca sauce and it was the same, no taste at all. the polenta was flavorless (coming from italian family we love polenta) the chicken was dry, and the puttanesca a joke like out of a tomato can! all food was cold and with no taste. Then my two friends had the duck which was just barely alright. For entree we shared a plate of zucchini which was just ok (it wasn’t even half a zucchini on the plate), and some grilled vegetables, (that well, you can’t really go wrong with that), plain dry grilled vegetables . We told the waitress when she asked us about how was our meal, and very kindly they offer us two desserts an apple pie and a chocolate cake, and both were the same quality of the food! the apple pie was made with something like boiled mashed apples? Not sure how to describe it, with a very hard pastry and again, tasteless. the chocolate cake seemed to have been in the fridge for at least a few days, it was hard as rock, completely dry and the taste was the same as when you leave something uncovered in the fridge for a very long time and you forgot it was there!
It wasn’t really worth trying to discuss with the waitress anything as it’s not their responsibility to provide for a good quality of food. I’ve payed almost £200 for the four of us. 
Really not worth any of that. 
The day before we went to a small restaurant around there Bura Bistro ( just by mere coincidence) we payed half the price of this dinner and the food was absolutely delicious and great service!",,Apr 2024

I sort of arrived desperately late at night, close to closing time at midnight, because I wondered if anyone had a spare iPad charging cable I could borrow overnight, as I completely forgot mine at the last hotel I stayed at. Thankfully a member of staff had an extra cord they let me use, and when I asked politely (not expecting a yes) if I could keep it and return it tomorrow morning, they were more than willing to allow it.

Duke,"Hove, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"We stopped by here as we wanted some tea, and not only tea, but cake too. Tea and cake together is hard to find in the Dubrovnik Old Town. The choices of cake looked lovely so we took a seat overlooking the square in front of Orlando’s Column. We only waited about 3-4 minutes for a free table which is well worth it. Many folks came along and when told there were no free tables, they just walked off again. So it was well worth the short wait and we ended up with the best table on the terrace. We were at the front, far right hand corner, overlooking the square. There is seating inside, and even a superb restaurant out the back overlooking the City Port, but we never did that. 

We order our tea and cake and sat watching the world stroll by. A great place to not only people watch, but we saw a couple of newly weds having their photographs taken in the square too. Being a devoted tea drinker, the tea was the best tea I had since I left the UK several weeks prior. It was the most enjoyable pot of tea I had ever had. The pot served two cups, and I even asked if the tea was a viable to buy anywhere (as I am travelling around Europe for a few months and I was desperate for some decent English breakfast/black tea. Sadly, it was not available to buy except here, alas, alas. My partner had a huge slice of apple pie and I had ‘Cake of the Day’, which was chocolate cake with a tiny hint of orange. I don’t normally like chocolate orange as a combination but this was delicious! The tea was so devine and in such a great location to enjoy it that we ordered more. I couldn’t tell you about the food, nor the experience on the other side but I strongly recommend you try anything here for the fine experience. The servers were incredibly smart and professional and very attentive. They were all very handsome in their uniforms and looked like male models. If you ever fancy some fine tea and cake - together, this is the place to go.",,Sep 2023

Pauline H,null,null,3,null,null,null,null,"Very mixed opinion…

We had reserved a table the day before for the following evening, when we arrived, no reservation in our name, we had to “fight while speaking English” to be deigned to accept us…
Once this bad experience was over, we ordered a black risotto (which was very good, I enjoyed it) for €21 and my partner “the chef’s pasta”, so…. Never seen. Pasta for €18 mixed with a kind of carrot and beetroot puree without much flavor...
So far, really not great and very expensive.
Let's not talk about the drinks which are also excessively expensive.

In short, the plus points:
- the framework
- risotto

In really bad points:

- the noise
- pasta
- the costs ! (You will definitely find excellent quality at a better price elsewhere in Dubrovnik)

I expected more based on the comments... quite disappointed for my part.",,Sep 2023

Second, the location is stunning. Whether you are facing the harbour or the square, or eating inside, the atmosphere is just perfect. Third, the service was second to none. All the waiting staff were great and sometimes watching them, it was like it had been choreographed. But we must give a special mention to Nemanja. He was friendly, attentive, knowledgable, gave us great advice on the wine, and absolutely impeccable in the service he provided.

I am talking about the Arsenal Restaurant that is situated in the fortress with a great view to the harbour and a waiter named ""ERMIN"" who is a professionally trained waiter who knows that presentation and information make for a great meal. 
This restaurant is not cheap to eat at (140 Euros for 3 not including the tip).
This restaurant is nicely appointed, very clean and efficiently ran by well organized servers, which included Ermin.
Ermins recommendations and his upbeat personality made this meal a treat to be remembered.
Thanks to Ermin, he turned an otherwise waisted day in the old town fortress into something enjoyable and positive.

Olivia H,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"This was our favourite meal in Dubrovnik. The view was incredible so we expected it to be extremely expensive (even more so than what is typical for the old town) but it was about the same as other restaurants without the view.
The service was excellent and very friendly. The food was also some of the best we had during our trip - we got the beef gnocchi and black risotto. 
The place is usually full, especially for dinner so book in advance if you can. We went for lunch after we didn’t manage to get a dinner reservation.
One thing to note: you are allowed to smoke at the table as it is an open air restaurant. This is standard in the area but something to bear in mind (it took something away from the meal when smoke floated over from a neighbouring table). It would have been nice if they separated some tables for those who want to smoke.",,Sep 2023

We planned to visit on our last night, however, due to rain, a number of terrace seats were unavailable and we were refused, we revisited twice after and got into the restaurant on our third attempt.

The restaurant was beautiful, the atmosphere was excellent and the staff and food was fantastic. I had the gnocchi and my partner had the linguini, both were extremely tasty and came out promptly after ordering.

Following our mains we were offered a free dessert due to our numerous attempts to get in, which was unnecessary but a lovely gesture. Left feeling full and satisfied after a very lovely evening.

Overall, we were dead impressed with the quality of service and standards of the restaurant, going above and beyond for their customers. Thank you for a great date night and we hope to visit you again soon!",,Aug 2023

Laura,null,null,5,null,null,null,null,"Saw this restaurant whilst on a walk around the old port area and immediately put it on my list of things I wanted to do whilst in Dubrovnik. I tried to reserve a table for 2, for dinner, however was told they were fully booked until the end of July, but we were welcome to try our luck on the night.

Well, we did, and we were not disappointed! Despite not having a reservation, the staff were extremely welcoming and sat us in the bar area until a table became available. This was maybe a 5 minute wait. There were plenty of others doing the same thing, so maybe they don’t offer some tables for booking to avoid being let down. I wanted to be water side, as that was my favourite view of Croatia so far, and that’s where we were sat. I believe there are also tables in the town side which looked equally as beautiful.

Service was honestly second to none. We both had the steak, which was perfect. The view was ofcourse breathtaking. 

This restaurant comes with a premium price tag, however for the quality of food, the view, atmosphere, and service, it felt more than reasonable (especially compared to Dubrovnik prices). Comparable to London I would say. Service charge hasn’t been automatically added on in our trip so far, not sure if that’s normal for Croatia, so be sure to tip! 

Highly recommend. Will definitely be coming back should we ever visit Dubrovnik again.",,Jun 2023

I ordered a latte. Seems to be a thing in Dubrovnik that the latte's are small, but this was the smallest one I've had yet.

I was expecting it to be really strong due to the small size of the cup but I was very wrong.
It was a perfectly lovely smooth creamy latte with a great coffee flavour and wasn't too strong at all.

We really enjoyed just sitting for 40 minutes watching the boats come in and out.

As it was fairly cold we decided to skip the starters and only had a main course and bottle of wine. I chose the chicken puttanesca with polenta, the chicken was overcooked and dry. My husband chose the Black risotto with cuttlefish and sage, which he said was a bit on the salty side. As it was so cold and breezy our food was getting cold very quick.

jamiammuddy,null,null,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"During our 10 weeks in Dubrovnik, from January - March, Arsenal become our go-to place for both afternoon coffee and special dinners out. Initially we went because it was one of the few restaurants in the Old City open during the winter. But, we kept returning even after March brought us many other options. Every experience was delightfully pleasant, from the service to the ambience to the food. We were so warmly greeted by the wait staff at every visit. They are real professionals who know how to easily engage in conversation but are also good about giving you space to just ""be."" There is no rushing to turn over tables here. They also obviously enjoy and take pride in their work. (Our favorite waiter Ivo once told us he likes ""everything"" about working there, naming in particular the years-long relationships with his colleagues and the fresh food that is all made in-house.) There is no place that you can sit that doesn't have a touch of magic: on the Stradun terrace, upstairs under the arched ceiling, in the front room, or on the back terrace overlooking the eastern harbor. The food is impeccable. We had the sea bass and vegetables in parchment paper over and over, enjoying it immensely each time. The black risotto was the best we had anywhere along the coast and included wonderful garnishes of fried sage and furled rice paper. A daily special roast duck was also very memorable. The chocolate cake with a layer of orange marmalade is delicious, as is the almond cake. There was nothing we tried that wasn't either very good or exceptional - all a great quality for the upscale but reasonable prices. Another thing we appreciated about Arsenal is that it seems to be a regular part of the community - from being filled with locals meeting for coffee to serving drinks and pastries to the music patrons exiting the KMD theater next door after the symphony's annual masquerade concert. In short, we enjoyed Arsenal so much that we chose to eat there for our last dinner out at a restaurant prior to our departure from Dubrovnik. Ivo was our waiter once again and - as always - made our evening warm and memorable. We thank him, Robert, Blaz, and all the other wait staff who so graciously welcomed us time and again.",,Mar 2023

Claire B,"Long Beach, California",USA,5,null,null,null,null,"Great food and great service. 

Visiting Dubrovnik in the winter means cold temperatures, high winds, and beautiful bright blue skies. It also means much fewer tourists than in the spring and summer. And while that is a huge positive, the negative is that many of the city’s restaurants are closed for the season. Fortunately, Gradska kavana Arsenal Restaurant is not one of them. Situated next to The Rectors Palace right off the main street, it is a cozy, welcoming cafe/restaurant. There are casual sitting areas and proper tables and chairs downstairs and upstairs. (There is outside seating too in the front where one can see and be seen.)

We were greeted warmly and sat at our table. Our waiter was Ivan. Cocktails were ordered and duly arrived. In our admittedly limited experience with this city’s restaurants, we can vouch that these were the best Old Fashioneds we’ve had here. The food menu isn’t extensive, but there is a daily list of specials. We started with sharing a seasonal salad and the soup of the day - a cream based zucchini soup. The salad was lovely - crisp, fresh ingredients in a perfectly balanced vinaigrette. The soup was delicious, and left us wanting more. For mains we had the gnocchi with bourbon sauce off the menu and duck breast with polenta and candied pecans off the specials list. Both dishes were well executed. They presented well and were as tasty as we could have hoped. The beef strips in the gnocchi dish were tender and not overdone, and the gnocchi itself was perfectly cooked. The duck breast was delicious and went very well with the white polenta and cherry sauce with pecans it was served on. We enjoyed a bottle of Dingač Edivo from their accessible wine list. Mains were followed by a super light and fluffy cheesecake from the pastry case and a couple of complimentary glasses of a local karob liqueur. 

Throughout the evening our waiter Ivan was friendly and attentive. He took care of our needs with just the right amount of chat and interaction, and we enjoyed his service thoroughly. 

We highly recommended this lovely place and hope that you sit at one of Ivan’s tables. 

P.S. We also stopped in here for a light lunch on the afternoon of our arrival in Dubrovnik after a rough 2 days of travel to get here. We enjoyed their chicken salad from the light lunch section of the menu and the truffle and mushrooms pasta. Both were delicious and we would heartily recommend this restaurant for lunch as we.

mrskrun,"Larvik, Norway",Norway,5,null,null,null,null,"Gradska Kavana Arsenal has become my favorite restaurant in Dubrovnik. The atmosphere in the restaurant makes you feel like a royalty in the olden days. The view in the restaurant is spectacular. 

Upon entry, we were greeted by staff, so professional and yet so friendly. For us, they represented Croatia so well that we fell in love with the friendliness and warmth of the Croatian people.

We ate our first breakfast in Dubrovnik at this fine restaurant. The ambience may scare you to enter thinking it’s way more expensive than other restaurants in the Old City of Dubrovnik, but to be honest, it’s the same almost.

The breakfast included a basket of all sorts that we may or may not eat, like honey, marmalades and so on. See photos posted here. 

The restaurant has a different kind of class, high class feel, which makes any food seem special. Anyway, the food they serve are very delicious and for that reason we came back and ate our last dinner at this restaurant with a bottle of wine of course.

We had a fantastic and memorable dinner. We ordered very delicious food that I still remember until now. We had double order of squid as well. I wish to come back and eat at that restaurant again. 

We also received a discount card from them which we used to eat in another restaurant that belongs to their group of restaurants. We ate breakfast the next day there at Dubravka 1836. 10% discount. Good deal. 

I love this restaurant so much that I made a youtube video about it and some facebook and instagram reels as well.

The customer service we received on all occasions we visited was second to none-literally outstanding from our various waiters including Adnan, Anthony and the lady who greets and makes reservations called Maria-thank you so much. We also had another waiter who served us one afternoon who wore glasses (sorry I didn’t get chance to get your name) but he too was great and gave my wife some nice advice about a dish she enquired about. 
We dine out in nice restaurants a lot but have to say this restaurant and the food they serve is now in our top ten, and our top ten includes the likes of The Chiltern Firehouse and The Ivy. Even when the restaurant had to close for a private party one afternoon, Maria still managed to squeeze a booking in for us slightly earlier, so we really appreciate all your support.

Chi,null,null,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"I would like to commend the management for immediately addressing the issues I encountered during my lunch here (first review at the bottom for context and fairness). They were quick to apologize, investigate what happened, and offered a complimentary meal. I was able to have dinner here on the same day - my last full day in Dubrovnik and the dinner experience made up for the mishaps that occurred during my lunch there. At first I didn't want to go back anymore and would rather try another restaurant, but thought I'd give it a chance since Mario was very sincere and apologetic in his messages. They were able to accommodate despite the last minute notice, and it did not disappoint. They gave me one of the best tables by the harbour side, seafood was fresh and the wine pairings were amazing, the customer service was a hundred times better - like it was a totally different restaurant from my lunch experience. I appreciate the friendliness of my waiter, taking the time to explain the origins of the olive oil and some of the local wines, offering a heater and putting a blanket on my shoulders when it got windy. Accountability and the proactive initiative by management to makeup for their lapses are rare, and speak volumes about the company's professionalism.

I am a person of color (South East Asian, not the ""fancy"" Asian) who look like I'm in my 20's, dining alone for a light lunch, and was possibly profiled by the first waiter to a minimum level of service he was willing put an effort on. I really do hope the staff will be reminded or re-trained to treat customers equally no matter what race or how they look like. I will still go back to Dubrovnik and eat here again and hopefully experience the same level of service during my dinner here.

initial review of my lunch experience:

Discriminatory, Insulting, Inattentive Staff, Gave Me Fast Food Style Service

It's the first time in my entire life that when I asked to have my leftover food to go, the waiter gave me a styrofoam container to put the food in there myself. No worries, I can do that but it's terribly, shockingly insulting, especially seeing how attentive they were to other guests. The wind blew the table linens and knocked over the condiments, they fixed other table's set up but just walked past me. Also I was the only table where they didn't serve a bread basket and olive oil and balsamic vinegar, they took a while to get my order and didn't offer that bread basket or even water. The only good thing about this place is the view, food is so-so. I really wanted to like this place and have coffee after my lunch but I felt so discriminated by staff and couldn't help but burst to tears.",,Oct 2022

The service after the main course however, was excruciatingly slow. As if suddenly our table had lost all importance. Our waiter seemed too happy to spend his time flaunting his knowledge at all the other tables. That in itself is a great quality, but not if it's at the expense of service.

Spent about 30-40 minutes waiting to order dessert. Spent another thirty minutes waiting to order coffee. Then another 30 minutes waiting to get the check. Each time, I had to call him to the table myself.

Djenita Pasic,null,null,5,null,null,null,null,"Gradska kavana is the ultimate coffee shop and restaurant in Dubrovnik, and Croatia as a whole. Once in Dubrovnik, one must come and enjoy a variety of services and foods it has to offer - either on the terrace overlooking Stradun and the main Old City square, or Arsenal, the terrace overlooking the most beautiful old port in the world.

When in Dubrovnik, we always go for mid-morning coffee - in our case cappuccino (the best ever) on the city-side terrace. We read the newspaper, people watch or meet with friends and family. Gradska kavana offers amazing breakfast - from salmon tartines with champagne, to eggs Benedict, to simple bread, butter and preserves baskets. Or just heavenly croissants that melt in your mouth… During the day and evening, the offer becomes more elaborate but equally fantastic. A lot of delicious fish items or vegetarian options, but also meats and desserts to die for. The wine and cocktail list is very long and good, too. Whenever you go, something will catch your eye and make you happy.

However, the best thing about this place is its people. All of the waiters, servers, hostesses, cooks, managers and cleaning staff are just amazing. Many of them have been working at Gradska kavana for many years and function as a well-oiled machine that feels like family. Professionalism at its best. Impeccable dress, professional attitude, smiling faces and good humor. I am forever grateful for every moment I spent at Gradska kavana. Every day is a celebration there - come and enjoy!",,Sep 2022
Denisa,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",Romania,5,null,null,null,null,"The seafood and fish were fresh and cooked well. I thought everything tasted good, though the sea bass was not grilled, I would say it was rather cooked in the oven on top of some veggies, tasty nonetheless. I myself ordered the mussels “buzara” which I enjoyed a lot. They were exactly what I was looking for: fresh, not too seasoned, a simple Croatian dish, perfect for the southern heat. Also, the view is even better than the pictures, our table was clean, we did not wait too long for our food and overall the service was good. If I ever visit Dubrovnik again I would go back for another meal for sure. My advice: if you enjoy fish cooked in a certain way, just ask them how they make it before you order!",,Aug 2022

Ana Mîrza,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",Romania,3,null,null,null,null,"We enjoyed a nice meal at this restaurant, the view and the location is absolutely great. The appetizers were also very tasty and the olive oil was very fulfilling. However, the food didn’t meet our expectations. I had the salmon fillet which came highly recommended, but the taste was no more than average, along with the vegetables it came with. Honestly, you have a pretty high chance of cooking salmon that tastes better at home. The mussels were not seasoned and not flavorful at all, and the wine sauce that was supposed to accompany them was a watery pool at the bottom of the plate. The sea-bass was just boiled and not seasoned again, and no side dish came along with it. Chef’s burger was the best thing at our table, still could be using some improvement but it was pretty good nonetheless.
The service was good and the waiters took good care of us.",,Aug 2022

BillyBurns,null,null,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"The restaurant is located right on the edge of the old harbour so the views are great and with the open terrace you get to feel the buzz of the city without having to dine in the street.

The prices are very reasonable with a risotto main around £13 and yet the food is of excellent quality. We looked at quite a few restaurants (including the two more expensive ones under the same ownership as this one - Nautica & Panorama) and are very pleased to have made this choice. 

I had concerns that you would be paying for location at the expense of quality of food and service but that could not be further from the truth. The service provided by our waiter Ante in particular really did take this to another level. His knowledge of all the dishes, wine recommendations and clear passion for his job really helped this meal rival many we have had at far more expensive, often Michelin starred restaurants. 

One thing to note is that it does get busy but if you haven't made a reservation and are reading this while trying to decide where to eat this evening fear not for all is not lost - they do hold some tables back for walk-in diners so you might still be in luck and get to enjoy what we found to be a great dining experience. I hope you find it to be as good as we did!",,Aug 2022

Ante, our server was quick to arrive and offer support with the menu, asking if we had any questions and making some suggestions. 

The wine was delicious, extra time was taken to explain the origins of the wine, which was a nice mother and daughter story which felt apt as I was dining with my mother.

GARRY P,"Hastings, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,3.0,5.0,4.0,null,"This popular restaurant is one of four under common ownership by ""Nautika"" in Dubrovnik (see also my review of ""Dubravka 1836"") and its well worth booking in the high season to avoid a potentially long wait and to get a prime table overlooking the Old Harbour. ""Arsenal"" is perfectly located in the heart of the Old City close to the Ploce Gate, with tables extending from a small terrace at the rear overlooking St. Blaise Church to a larger terrace at the front overlooking the Harbour. 

From an extensive menu (the restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner) we shared on excellent starter of traditional Croatian mussels ""buzaru"" (in a sauce of breadcrumbs, tomatoes, garlic, wine and olive oil) followed by mains of ""brodet"" (assorted fish stew) and veal in sage sauce and garnished with asparagus and mushrooms. All these dishes were very flavoursome and well-presented and we followed them with some delicious desserts. We were also very satisfied with our selection of a dry Croatian Rose wine (""Kutjevo""- HRK 250/c.£31) and we then ordered coffees with 2 well-priced Grand Marnier at HRK 44 per glass. 

The staff deserve a special mention; in particular, our waiter (""Tom""?) was humorous, friendly, attentive and professional. Thanks!

The final bill for dinner for 2 was HRK 1,166 (c.£146), but fortunately we had a 10% discount voucher (keep your eyes open for the local Restaurant Guide which contains some discounts), reducing the final bill ex. tip to HRK 1,049 (c.£131); obviously not cheap, but fairly typical for a good restaurant in Old City Dubrovnik.",,Jul 2022

Our serendipitous encounter (after being exhausted from travel and not researching our first night dining decision) ended up becoming our daily go-to for the next 4 days. Sometimes we stayed for just a drink and others, for the full dining experience which includes solid affordable fare and 2 personalities. The front restaurant space provides a window into the pace and variety of travelers in OT while delivering the perfect location to view beautiful historic aesthetics and access to central restaurants/bars, legendary coral jewelers, nightlife, and more. The back space is right on the water facing the impeccably gorgeous blue Adriatic Sea which is surrounded by stunning cliffs. The view here is incredibly picturesque and provides a completely different experience.

The staff here is also exceptional, especially Mario who went above and beyond to make my cousin feel special on her birthday plus, he always dedicated extra time to make us both smile and laugh whenever we visited (while still providing top notch service to every patron).

We loved Arsenal more than any other restaurant (and there are a ton of worthy candidates in OT) based on the above. We were instantly comfortable from night one and the lively, yet warm energy of their environment consistently earned our business. 5+ stars across the board!

I ordered the seafood risotto. Oh, my! I had to resist the urge to say, "" This is so good!"" after each bite. 

My husband ordered the duck, and he reports that it was every bit as good as my risotto.

He finished with the creme caramel. Yet again, it was as tasty as it was beautiful. 

The setting is just stunning! Unlike many well-positioned restaurants, here the food lives up to the setting.

It's a really amazing restaurant! The food is literally to die for. Their truffle pasta & salmon was soo good, I wanted to order more. And their prosciutto and Dalmatian cheese was some of the best I had in the whole of Croatia - it was surprisingly addicting; And I'm not even a cheese person. 

And not only that, but the service was 1st class, and very outstanding. The staffs, Ivan, Stefan, Ante, were all very accommodating and really gave good 1st class service. They do their jobs very well. 

As for the location, what more can you ask for? It's situated right in the heart of all the action and perhaps the most beautiful part in Dubrovnik. Not to mention, the music was superb; They played really nice jazz, chill lounge, Schwarz & Funk, bossa nova, etc, and not just generic youtube BGM piano lists. 

Perhaps the only con I have is that it's on the pricier side; (Wines start at a minimum of 220 kunas) but it's what you expect from such an amazing place and it's really worth it.

Miku&Mussu,null,null,3,3.0,2.0,4.0,null,"The service was good and we were happy that they were willing to arrange us a table at the seafront with a limited 2 hour time, before the next reservation. The harbour view is lovely, the cuisine was good and the service was fast, so we were happy with the quality of food. 

What was strange, was that the waiter insisted that we must order mushrooms and we can't leave them out of the dishes just because we don't like to eat mushrooms. Only allergy would have been a sufficient reason for him to leave the mushrooms out. So then even though, we had asked to leave all mushroom sauce and mushroom related things out of the food, the food came with mushrooms. 

Another thing which was odd, was that the waiter thought he knew better than us, whether we would like to order dessert or not. We hadn’t eaten all day before this, so certainly we were very hungry. But the waiter informed that he will not place an order of the desserts as we had requested, as he thinks we will probably want to reconsider that. You would think that the waiter would be happy to make as much sales as possible, but he didn’t want to do that. 

There was still plenty of time left to eat out of the 2 hours limited time, so this was not the issue. Then we decided, that since the waiter is so reluctant to sell us desserts, we will go to another restaurant after this, to enjoy desserts.",,Aug 2021

We shared the Dalmatian cheeses and the Zucchini/Courgette. Both were divine, of particular note was the feta that came with the zucchini. 

I couldn’t help myself. I had to have the tenderest fillet steak with mushroom reduction. Just as good as last time. Wife had the seafood risotto……perfect. Son insisted on having the truffle and mushroom pasta. This lasted seconds as I can confirm from tasting it myself. Daughter had chicken and polenta.

The food was pretty amazing for the most part. We started off with the octopus salad with caviar, which was fresh, and really unique. The octopus was actually not rubbery at all, and delicious! We then had our favorite dish there, the fish stew! It was just amazing, with so many great flavors all packed into this great bowl. It was spicy, but not overwhelming. Our least favorite dish had to be the cuddlefish squid ink, which was tasteless, and needed a ton of salt. We didn't even finish it was that bad. At least our waiter didn't charged us for it.

The service there started off perfectly! Our server was so attentive from the moment we arrived, and had some great ideas for local dishes. Sadly, our experience wasn't an excellent one, due to the fact that he completely forgot about us for about 35 minutes. Never checked if we needed anything, or even came by our table. That was somewhat frustrating, as it started off so promising. That being said, he was a great server who got overwhelmed with too many tables. 

Our overall experience there was a very positive one though. The food was outstanding for the most part, the service was pretty good, but more than anything, the views were just breathtaking! I highly recommend going there for at least even a few drinks, as you won't regret it!",,Sep 2020

This IS fine dining and luxury service I would expect at the Four Seasons. We spilled coffee on the table, just a half cup. The waiters were understanding, kind, and on the spot. They switched the table entirely -- think ""Goodfellas"" when a table was made out of nowhere. They disappeared the soiled tablecloth and recharged all drinks on the table, no charge. They greet you like old friend and treat you like their family. They make personal recommendations for follow-on attractions or other cafes and venues to sample or try based on your tastes and desires. 5 star service, not a penny less...

Atmosphere: Dining outside city-side, or outside Arsenal (Harbour) side, or indoors you are in for a treat. 
Indoors, main sitting: Try upstairs, very intimate, cozy, world happening below. 
Indoors Long Bar / Large Dining Room: Elegance, action, a constant pleasant din of diners. 
Outside city-side: People watching, feels exclusive. 
Outside Arsenal-side: Ah, the old Arsenal, where ships were victualed and rearmed ages ago. This place feels old, ghostly even -- peaceful all its own, sunlight and brisk Adriatic air. 

Meal: Croatian food is based in simple elegance. The food here is amazing, starters to deserts. The wine list is large, the wait staff will help you arrive at the best choice. Croatian dry sparkling wine steals my heart.

Service - We're American's and we can be demanding... on some visits, there were as many as 12 of us, and we only speak English, so we're a lot to handle. The level of service was consistently high, and attentive. On our return visits, the staff recognized and welcomed us warmly. 

Food - Their menu is tightly focused and we enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner here! At dinner, we had beautifully presented, delicious fresh fish, steak and veggie entrees, mouth watering apps, and tasty salads (in the Side Dish section of the menu). I specifically want to call out the Sea Magic app (tuna tartar, shrimp, oyster) - it was soooo good! For breakfast, sustaining eggs and pastries.

We all had a fish dish, some had fish stew, and others the tuna, but everyone agreed that it was as close to perfect as you can get.

The service we received was some of the best we have experienced in Europe, the waiter was incredibly attentive and was very knowlegable about the menu, traditional cuisine and local produce and also made an effort to connect to his guests by sharing personal stories and jokes which contributed to a fun evening! From our viewpoint it looked like all guests received individualised service of this standard.

The food was so full of local flavour, seafood was fresh and everything was beautifully presented!

Entrees:

We ordered a bottle of the Croatian rosé which was light & fresh & a bottle of sparkling water. 

For staters: the mussels & the octopus

The mussels were tasty but needed proper debearding & were extremely tiny. 6/10 
The octopus starter was ok, though the black caviar topping made it too salty 5/10

The main courses: fish of the day with vegetables- verdict on fish - fresh & tasty but the vegetables tasted like yesterday’s left overs. 
Fish stew- mussels/fish & super tiny prawns. 9/10 for flavour but the seafood itself was underwhelming. 5/10

We got a pistachio cake as a treat from the restaurant at the end, thank you.

We were shown to a pleasant table on the Old Town Port side where we watched the tenders from the cruise ships spew out literally thousands of gawping passengers, herded into walking tour groups. We felt slightly smug on our comfortable balcony.

Croatia is not yet a gourmet destination by any criteria but the meal we had here was one of the best we experienced, certainly in Dubrovnik itself.

The general vibe of the restaurant, is relaxed and friendly. During our visits, we noticed certain small details that showed the restaurant is well managed.

Daniel, our waiter on both occasions, deserves a special mention - humorous, professional, with a very good memory (he remembered us and what we ate from our first visit, warmly welcoming us on our second!).

The service here is amazing - very attentive staff who checked in with us often, kept our wine glasses full, and timed all of our courses perfectly! 5 bubbles for the view and service alone, but the food was good too ;).

I started with the octopus salad which looks magical. Check my photos. UNREAL. Topped with black caviar, there were chunks and chunks of fresh octopus and it was packed with flavor. SO fresh. My partner got the Dalmatian ham of course and loved it. You can never go wrong with the charcuterie in Europe. For mains, I tried something new and got the bacon-wrapped monkfish. The fish was a little dry but it was meaty and delicious nonetheless. My partner got the steak with baked potato. Now THAT was satisfying. If you are a meat and potatoes person, you need it. The herbed cheese on top was amazing, and the sauce for the steak was so, so good.

We did try the dessert, an orange ""creme brulee""/pannacotta style dessert was described to us. It was definitely a firm, egg-based custard. It was not the highlight and I would have gone with a cake in hindsight or saved room for more ice cream! Just too egg-y and not sweet at all. Could be a preference. It was beautiful.

The menu provided a wide selection of seafood and meat dishes ( Not advisable for those looking for vegan dishes), in appetizers and main dishes. I had the hot appetizer of Sea and Mountains, adequate portion of salmon and prawns, but I would have liked to been given a slightly more generous amount of wild mushrooms. Interesting pasta dipped in squid ink but I did not seem to taste any different. My companion ordered the Tuna from the specials menu, which was excellent when cooked medium-rare.
I would recommend asking for the dessert from the waiter, as the Almond and White Chocolate cake especially was delicious!!

The food at best was very average.
Mussels for starters at 98kn each where very very salty and had a large number unopened, what did open were small and the flavour was overwhelmed by the saltiness of the liquor.
Mains, half marinated chicken was just bland chicken, belly pork one was OK and one was mainly fat and finally rib eye steak was good but cooked more than requested.

The restaurant is huge. He tells me it used to be an old shipping yard. Just beautiful. The food was good and fresh. 

Also, just to tell you how honest Damir is, when it came time to pay I paid with my credit card but like everywhere else in Croatia, you can't leave a tip on your credit card so you have to leave it in cash. My were just coming from Prague where the exchange rate was different. I left him too much (the equivalent of 50% of the bill). He quickly gave me the money back and told me I must have made a mistake because it was too much.

The staff are extremely professional but very friendly and courteous with it. We went there, probably looking a bit sweaty and dishevelled on an very hot day, and the service was fantastic.

I looked this up on TripAdvisor prior to entering. The reviews were right. This restaurant was a really nice place to dine. Upon entry, the host asked if we had a reservation, which we did not. He did find us a table though. 

I enjoyed the salmon filet with beets, asparagus, and potatoes. I would have liked more asparagus, but that was fine. My boyfriend ordered the sea bass filet and enjoyed it. For cocktails, we had the Burning Desire and the Taste of Spring. Both were very refreshing on a very hot evening. We ordered the rozata for dessert, and it was a fantastic choice. 

I would recommend this restaurant for the view and the tasty food. The server was attentive and very friendly.",,Jun 2019

We had a fantastic server, who recommended wine, dishes and shared relevant information, he was always available when we needed. 

The food was brilliant and easily the best restaurant we visited on our trip. Surprisingly the meal was just above average cost, considering the quality I was really surprised especially with other restaurants so overpriced in old town. 

The atmosphere was of chilled casual smart ambience. To get the full experience you do want to dress smart casual and if you want a sea/port view then I’d suggest a reservation way in advance. 

Lastly the ambient music gave the restaurant such a beautiful feel, especially as the sunset. It was only half way through the meal we saw it was live, 2 gentlemen’s playing continuously. They were fantastic and I thanked them on the way out.

We didnt have a reservation but got one of the last tables and the waiter moved us closer to the harbour before we ordered as a table became available. The setting and ambiance was amazing and before we had even had any food we already loved this restaurant. The service was the perfect pace allowing enough time to enjoy the setting and each course. Lovely bread was served after ordering and topped up by our server. I had the seafood pasta for starter and sea bass for main, both were delicious and really fresh seafood. My husband had the meat and cheese board to start and steak for main which were also excellent. The portions were very good, especially the seafood pasta to start which was very generous. Throught the meal a piano played beautiful music in the background including the game of thrones theme tune which we really enjoyed! Would recommend booking as we got lucky to get our table and ask for a table close to the harbour. The bill came to approx €100 which included 3 glasses of prosecco, 1 cocktail, 2 starters and 2 mains which for the quality, service and setting we thought was definitely worth it.

This restaurant has many tables and can offer external seating both out on the terrace facing the sea and out in the Main Street of old town. They also have inside seating presumably for the cooler months. The food is Reasonably priced, very tasty and excellent value for money. On the other hand however wine, so not such great value. The cheapest Merlot by bottle is 240.00kn. That said the wines are of a good quality, and do compliment the food well. The staff are very friendly, and our waiter Maro, in particular knew all about the food and wine the restaurant had to offer, making some excellent suggestions. We had a three course meal with wine for around £80. All aspects of the establishment were spotlessly clean, and attention to detail obvious both in presentation and staff training.

We had Croatian white wine that was dry but with the right acidity to go with the seafood, two different kinds of bread,a generous very fresh garden salad, an Octopus salad that was covered in caviar, just for starters. 
Our main courses were; three large pieces of sea bass grilled to perfection on top of a bed of julienne vegetables and a seafood risotto that was heavy on the seafood and light on the risotto. Outstanding!

The following evening the concierge managed to get us a table for dinner as a walk in- they were fully booked as expected.The food was wonderful,the service from an array of different staff was amazing.The meal was concluded with a complimentary glass of some local fig liqueur.
Special mention to the girl who looked after us during the meal and took the time to talk to us at the end. I forget her name- she was some kind of supervisor, taking orders for food,preparing tables for the next diners. She didnt deliver food or drink, but did deliver the liqueur.
Also,the pianist playing that evening was good.

However, when we asked for the bill at the end of the meal they refused to let us pay! The whole lunch free of charge just because two dishes came out in the wrong order.

Since the moment we arrived the hostess Marija made us feel welcome and treated us like any guest deserve. We got a table in the terrace and the restaurant offers plaids in case you find the temperature too chilly (heaters are available but where not needed at the moment).

Our waiter, Branimir, treated us as we were part of any royal family. Observing the attention given to the tables on the surroundings it seems to be the standard of the place, so you will never regret to have a meal there.

The menu has diverse choices of typical and international options. All of high quality and presentation. Our choices are in the pictures.

Despite we did not ask for dessert, Branimir took the initiative of treating us with a piece of their delicious orange/ chocolate cake, making it even more special when he discovered it was my birthday.

We ordered food and it was all good, very tasty, we were then offered a drink on the house To celebrate my birthday, a nice touch, it came with a free cake nicely presented on a plate.
I asked to pay the bill,on receipt of bill I glanced over it and noticed the free drinks had been added to it, my family told me to question this as it was £35 extra on drinks we didn’t order, they agreed that a mistake had been made and rectified the error, but as many have said these sort of thing should not happen in this type of establishment.

ilovebunnies89,"Singapore, Singapore",Singapore,3,null,null,null,null,"I have never been compelled to write a bad review or any reviews at all in general but I felt that my experience today had to be made known to the public or the management.

The service was lukewarm at best and at times, mediocre. When we arrived, there were a few servers around, but nobody came forward to ask if we wanted to sit or anything. Why else would we even go into the restaurant if we didn’t wanna eat there? When approached the servers, they scattered like ants. I didn’t stink, in fact, I just had a bath and wore an awesome fragrance. I didn’t look like a slob either, I had proper and in fact, some would say, very fashionable clothing on. But I’m Asian, I don’t know if that mattered, perhaps they were sick of having noisy Chinese tourists around. 

We were greeted by an annoyed looking female server in a tight bun (go figure) and our tables were not set properly after that. We had to ask for a plate because we were missing one. Come on... really?

Food was pretty good. We had the mussels, pork belly, cod fish and risotto. They were all fine. 

The four of us agreed that the service was a great letdown. We’ve been in Croatia for two weeks and have eaten at restaurants almost everyday. We’ve never felt more unwelcome in a restaurant. Service elsewhere has been good, if not, impeccable. 

We also got the Dubrovnik card and there was supposedly a 10% discount which they honoured anyway, but told us that their boss made an exception and the 10% doesn’t apply. It was strange because it was indicated online, perhaps the terms have changed. 

Towards the end, the young man who was serving us did thank us a couple of times and gave us a 10% discount card for the other restaurants under the same management but we will not return and I will not recommend this to my friends and family (not that they need my recommendation anyway because the restaurant is so large and prominent, the ranking is so high on TripAdvisor too).

I really wanted to like it, and I felt bad that my face soured towards the end of the meal but I was just so annoyed. But I did say my “please” and “thank you” so I was still civil. I mean, I kind of have a Resting B Face so perhaps they thought I was being unfriendly.",,Oct 2018

We ordered three starters between us Tuna Carpaccio, Octopus Salad and Red Risotto with Scallops plus a bottle of our favourite Edivo Dingac. The Waiter was very professional with the wine which was decanted and served at room temperature. The food was delicious and just what we had wanted. 

We saw someone being served for two Chateaubriand which looked fabulous. Another table had Sea Bream which was filleted at table side. They even brought out a huge whole fresh fish - perhaps Grouper to show a large table who turned it down but I’d have gladly eaten it. 

We seriously considered returning last night for dinner but went for Gatsby instead as wanted steak. No regrets but will return another time. 

Highly recommended.",,Oct 2018

Back to the food. We have dined the equivalent of Michelin Star in Australia and the food quality here is on par. My wife said the calamari was the best meal she has ever had.

Food was cooked excellently, fresh and moist, balanced in flavour and texture and presentation. Our waiter Ivan explained the wines and the choice was spot on.

We thanked Ivan for rescuing our honeymoon and he flitted off returning with a delicious cake, of chocolate ganache and fig, traditional Croatian, and two handsome glasses of champagne.

Matt D,null,null,3,null,null,null,null,"First the location is incredibly grand with a stunning harbour side view set back within stone arches. Waiter was polite and very busy but our starters came before our drinks. The food was good but aside from the octopus salad (see the plant pot in the pictures) none of it was on a par with the setting. Don’t get me wrong it was lovely and not as expensive as it’s surroundings would suggest but it didn’t stand out in any way. The mussels were surprisingly small in their shell, the squid was fine but maybe a little bland, I had a better squid dish in Perast, Montenegro for less money. The pork belly was nice the cauliflower purée worked well with the cherry sauce and fried apples but the pork was chewy and not brilliantly cooked. For me the octopus salad I had for starters was brilliant well thought out incredibly well presented to the point it made me smile if only the other dishes were at the same level! But the flip side is the price was reasonable for the area.",,Sep 2018

You have two choice either a table overlooking the old port of Dubrovnik or right at the end of the main thoroughfare in Dubrovnik Old town (Stradun). I don't think there is [possibly a restaurant anywhere with this kind of setting - a truly beautiful location - We had booked a table in advance and we opted for the Old Port side. We decided to share the fish dish of the day for 2 people and were treated by our waiter to the preparation of the fish before eating.

As this place is on the expensive side and we were running out of money we opted for one course each but that we could share, I chose a beetroot based seafood risotto while my partner had the calamari salad.

Jan Petter W,null,null,2,null,null,null,null,"Prebooked visit for two adults and a baby. A bit of confusion about baby carrier vs baby chair resulted in not getting menues for quite some time. No big deal; can easily happen. We asked for some hot water to mix some baby porridge, but that was surprisingly difficult. Coffee machine wasn't working due to electricity outage. They were still serving hot food, so how difficult can pot + water = hot water really be? YOU DO NOT OFFER A SIX MONTH OLD BABY HOT TAP WATER - THAT IS A HEALTH HAZARD! In the end, they managed to get some remaining water out of the coffee machine.
We ordered starters and mains, some soft drinks and some glasses of wine. The waiter took care to ask if we wanted the wine with the mains, but forgot to actually serve it and had to be reminded. 
The power returned and the sound system came on. A little while later, a two man band with piano and trumpet started playing soft and nice. Unfortunately, the sound system stayed on and the mix of soft and pop was not a good one. I had to point it out to the staff, before they switched it off. 
Finally; deserts. Ask your waiter for the cakes, was what the menu said. The waiter will list everything he remembers and you're supposed to just pick one from the 8-10 he lists. It's not easy to translate/explain unfamiliar names on a spoken list and you really get no time to decide, with the ""menu"" standing by the table, awaiting your desicion. We passed on deserts.

I can highly recommend the ham and pea risotto and i would go so far as to say that the seafood risotto is one of the best i have ever eaten. The mussels which is what i had for a starter was not one of my favorites purely for the fact that they use bread in the sauce and it becomes like a paste in your mouth, but the flavour was great and the mussels cooked to perfection.

However it was a real gem...the food was reasonable and very tasty (we had oysters and mussels) but the main attraction is the view looking out to the harbour and the romantic atmosphere. The service was initially very slow and it took a while to get asked for our drinks order, but once that was done the rest of the service was attentive and friendly. There was a keyboard and cello duo performing background music who were fabulous. They played pop songs but with a classical twist...we had lots of fun trying to guess the tune!",,Jun 2018

There was a table free at the front, as people were just leaving, so I asked for that one and after some discussion between a couple of the waitresses told I could have it if we waited whilst they prepared it. We were taken to a waiting area and a few minutes later taken to a side table, set back from the front and not the one we had been told we could have. When I queried it I was told it was reserved, which was rubbish as another couple had just walked in behind us and by this time there was another one free! So we were seated and we waited for a considerable amount of time without being asked what we wanted to drink or being acknowledged in any way. Consequently we got up and left - not impressed!

Craig M,"Woking, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"My partner and I spent the first and last morning of our trip at the Gradska Kavana Arsenal. First morning due to he high reviews, and the last morning because we couldn’t think of anywhere better to finish our trip before heading off to the airport!

You can choose to sit inside, as well as from two outdoor seating areas, one facing into the main square in its own off-street, raised area (slightly nicer and secluded compared to most other restaurants where you are seated essentially on the street), and another area facing out with fantastic views of the port - probably one of the most photogenic spots of the port in Dubrovnik!

Staff were friendly, helpful and polite on both occasions, and the food was well prepared. Though at first it may seem expensive, the main breakfast options (unless you wish to freestyle!) come with a basket of ~6-8 breads/croissants with plenty selection of jams, honey, Nutella, a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, hot drink, and a decently portioned main breakfast (Arsenal aka “full English” in our case); thus in all very reasonable!

Accept cash or card, and it seems if you wish to visit more than once, enquire about their discount card which they may offer for free on your first visit, which will save you around 5%+.",,Jun 2018

Michele J,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"I am reviewing the experience I have had over the course of one full week in Old Town, Dubrovnik where I had breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert repeatedly during my week stay. I didn't need to go anywhere else since the food quality and service was 5-stars! 

There are actually two dining experiences to this outstanding restaurant. The restaurant covers the entire width of the street with a town-side and a seaside. The ""town-side"" location is perfect to relax and people-watch in the main square. The ""seaside"" location is perfect to take your breath away from the beauty of the sea, and the landscape is a picture perfect postcard! 

Now that you know about the physical atmosphere, the staff and service must first be address as outstanding! 

I have met the most wonderful people who are part of this restaurant, and I hope you get the chance too! The hostesses, Maria and Nika are so friendly and helpful. I instantly felt like we have been friends forever. 

My main waiter, Marjio, is so professional, friendly and kind. He is very attentive and helpful. He offered comfortable blankets and a complimentary warm coffee drink on the night where it was slightly chilly. These little details are what are truly memorable and make an outstanding experience! 

As my friendships with everyone there grew, I got to know Igor, the Manager, and since I stayed quite a long time working from my laptop, he was so thoughtful to send over a beautiful tropical juice. I felt that I had a wonderful new group of friends. If you need a place for wifi, it is a great location and the seaside location you can sit next to beautiful flowers throughout the outside space. 

Everyone there greets you with a smile and is so respectful and friendly. This is very helpful and appreciated, especially as a solo traveler.

The food was delicious. I had the Arsenal breakfast (many times) with orange juice, eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, bread and a hot beverage (tea). They are generous to bring more hot water to replenish. I loved the cute bread basket and side of jams, Nutella, butter, and honey. For lunch, my favorites were the grilled octopus (amazing flavors) and the octopus salad (the presentation looks like a little plant is growing from soil). It was so tasty! 

For dinner, I had the seabass and chocolate fig pie dessert. One night for dinner there was a large reserved party and my dinner arrived a little later than planned (not by much time at all) but they surprised me with a cheesecake as an apology. I didn't need an apology but I was delighted how creamy and delicious the cake tasted.

In the evening, there is musical entertainment with a trumpet player one night, a pianist another, and sometimes a combination of the two. It is truly a wonderful place to relax and enjoy life! I'm so thankful I had this experience!",,May 2018

The 'Arsenal, experience truly was sublime. The food, view , staff, wines and atmosphere was of exceptional quality. The care and attention by the staff was probably some of the best service I had encountered and other restaurants world wide would benefit from observing their brilliant and professional practice.
A warmth of welcome with beautiful Croatian sunshine in this fabulous restaurant would be a travesty not to indulge.

The place serves amazing breakfast, coffee, pastries, lunch and dinner. Everything I ate was delicious, from the cocktails, to the tuna tartar to the cheesecake who is for sure a must try. 
The location is great because you have different areas. One that is more for a quick coffee break or cocktail which is at the front where you have a nice view of the main street of Dubrovnik. Then you can eat inside but the best if at the back where you have stunning view of the port and dubrovnik walls and it is impossible not to fall in love with this gorgeous scenery. 
Though the most important thing about this place is the service which is perfect. Everyone working there is really friendly, professional and will do anything to help you and to make you have the best time while you are there. 
So I would like to thank all the staff for its wonderful work and commitment to service which is a tough industry. Special thanks to Valentino, Ivan, Marijo, Mario and all your other colleagues. Sorry for forgetting the name. Without its amazing staff the place would not be the same.",,May 2018

Food excellent – interesting starters, then we shared a large sea bream, brought to our table to select, then baked and served with roasted vegetables and potatoes. Delicious! Expertly filleted and served at the table by Ivan, who then kindly procured an umbrella for us to dash back to our hotel during a short, late night cloudburst!
So good, we booked for Saturday night - same beautiful setting - dramatic, ghostly galleons drifting in and out the port - food with added theatre! 
This time the charming Marijo kept us 3 ladies supplied throughout the evening with great food and wine with good info about the local wines. A big added bonus was a great jazz duo - from the Dubrovnik Symphony no less, playing superbly, at just the right volume, throughout the evening.
We did eat at other places in Dubrovnik honest! But couldn't resist having lunch there on our last day - different, more buzzy atmosphere in the daytime, with boats in and out and great vantage point for people watching, but same good food and great service. We promised to give them a mention on TripAdvisor– deservedly so as this place certainly increased our enjoyment of this lovely town.

To start, we had a creamy truffle, mushroom and spaghetti dish which was lovely (though a little too creamy for my partner) and some mussels in a garlic and white wine sauce. Unfortunately whilst the mussels were tasty, the sauce with it was far too salty and overpowered any other taste.

The main dish of salmon fillet with the chosen white wine (the only medium dry one!) was incredible and we both really enjoyed it.

We were attracted by the location of this restaurant as it was next to the pier and was under the city walls. We were a little skeptical at first because we knew views and food quality doesn’t always come together. But we saw the reviews and decided to take our chances. 

We got a seat in the first row, sat under a 13th century arc and had the most amazing view of the harbour. 

We had the fish stew and the mussels. Both were amazing. The fish stew had a delicious sauce and the fish were of good quality. The mussels sauce was great as well.

More importantly, we received absolutely THE BEST SERVICE of all time (and we’ve been on holidays for 4 weeks now). The manager Tomislav was very friendly, introduced us a great wine and educated us a lot on Croatian wine! We asked for a takeaway of the bottle because we were so fond of it and the manager gave us a bottle on the house. We enjoyed absolutely EVERYTHING.

The prices are actually quite reasonable and we also had a 10% off card given to us when we were at the Mount Syrd restaurant. The service was very good and my wife did not particularly end up liking her pasta dish (my salmon was fine!) though it was just due to her not liking it, not that they made it badly. That happens once in a while when you choose something new to you. When our server noticed that she didn't finish her bowl he asked if anything was wrong and my wife just said it wasn't her thing, nothing they did wrong. Well, when we got our bill they took this off the total! They said if she didn't like it they wouldn't have her pay for it. Very classy! My only slight complaint was that the sliced bread pieces brought out were getting a little dry/stale...probably because they just weren't that busy yet.

Both the dishes looked stunning and tasted even better, fish was moist and cooked to perfection. I who hate mushy peas loved the pea purée, that good!
Staff were very caring and welcoming, and explained a lot about the local produce. Like other fine dining restaurants they didn’t keep straight face but smiled and made you comfortable the whole time. Time and time they checked if we liked everything or if they could offer us anything else,with big smiles on their face always.

Kerry N,"East Sussex, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"Stopped here for a coffee, ended up sampling local liqueurs... the fig one was nice... the wormword a bit like bad medicine. This then was followed by the grilled octopus, a plate of cheese and olives. It was such a lovely place to stop, people watch and enjoy the local art of fjaka. The service (Valentino) was great and very friendly. Would return",,Mar 2018

Mike K,"Bristol, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,5.0,4.0,null,"During a recent visit to Dubrovnik, we had two evening meals here - and were delighted with both. Extensive menu, food was lovely and the service was excellent.And food and drink prices were very reasonable.

And two very different dining areas - either on the terrace, facing into Old Town, or on the other side, facing Old Port... with lots of space in between.

Happy to recommend that you try it.",,Aug 2017
Dellaph_Kite,"Lincolnshire, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,null,null,null,null,"This is a large restaurant on the harbour, but for all that the service personable and very attentive; we arrived drenched from a sudden downpour and were wrapped in towels whilst our coats were dried out. Roberto our waiter was cracking, seek him out. The main thing about this restaurant, and it set me on a course for the rest of my stay in Dubrovnik, was the calamari. I am a particular fan of good calamari and have eaten the dish hundreds of times. It's a simple dish, grilled squid, but rarely is it perfectly served. Well, here it was, ten out of ten. It was good in other restaurants but none achieved the perfect ten. And it wasn't a one off. We were so impressed by our impromptu stop we returned in the evening - and more of our group had the calamari, again perfectly grilled. So if that's your thing, do yourself a favour. And if you don't, the rest of the food was well received by all, so worry not.",,Dec 2017
AshBassili,"Annapolis, Maryland",USA,1,null,null,null,null,"Bread was stale, chicken was cold and bland, drink portions were a joke. Eggs were made of butter, which was disgustingly greasy. Everything looked and tasted as if it was premade two days ago. The food came quick but at the cost of any sort of quality. Definitely would not come back again, ever.",,Jan 2018
Nat B,"Edgewater, Maryland",USA,1,null,null,null,null,"Would absolutely not come here again...our chicken was cold and stale, our cheeseburger buns were stale, my breakfast vegetarian option didn’t come with bread. We had to ask for our dirty dishes to be cleared well after we had finished. 

The only good thing is that the waiter took our orders very quickly after we arrived and the food arrived promptly.",,Jan 2018

Returned a couple of hours later with our other two friends in our group and did it all over again - minus the coat drying,,
Roberto a great host! and the chef a delight.",,Dec 2017
