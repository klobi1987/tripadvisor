Mauro De Luca,"Omegna, Italy",Italy,3,null,null,null,null,"On Nautika's website the restaurant calls itself ""the best in Dubrovnik"" and ""the sixth most romantic restaurant in the world"" according to Condé Nast Traveller magazine. Also on June 6, 2003, Nautika had the honor of hosting Pope John Paul II. For our special dinner in Dubrovnik we booked several days in advance specifically to have a table in the front row on the terrace with panoramic views of the sea and the fortresses of Lovrijenac and Bokar. Unfortunately they were unlucky: that evening a strong and cold wind blew, so we were placed in an interior room, however ancient and elegant, although without any panoramic view. Patience, we hope that next time we will be luckier with the reservation of the ""front row table"". 
We both tried the Bokar"" 5-course tasting menu, at €155 per person: although some courses were truly exceptional, I would say without a doubt that at Nautika you pay mainly for the location and the high-class Service they offer, rather than for the food itself. 
Finally, a strange thing: the waiter in white gloves was quick to pour us more wine as soon as he realized that our glasses were empty. On the contrary, it did not do the same with mineral water: that we had to serve it alone throughout the evening. Really a strange thing for such a listed location, but perhaps at the Nautika restaurant -""the best in Dubrovnik"" - it is used this way.",,Oct 2025
Stephen W,null,null,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"To sit on the wonderful terrace and enjoy the historic theatre of Dubrovnik's old town was one thing. To enjoy the exquisite food was another. To witness the enthralling evening display of a flock of Alpine swifts (birds we had never seen before) was utterly enchanting. Everything was first class. The cuisine, the service and the sense of humour. Can not be faulted. You will pay a pretty penny in silver but it is worth it because you will never forget it. Why? Because it will make you smile. Thank you Mario and all the staff, Steve Walsh. (We will return).",,Oct 2025

Everyone in our party ordered the Bokar tasting menu and we were not disappointed. The fish soup and the shrimp were standouts for me - so delicious. I really liked the unique olive oil pairings with each course. The service was impeccable and our waiter was knowledgeable and good natured. There is an extensive wine menu catering to all tastes and price points. Dinner at Nautika was a highlight of my trip to Croatia and I would recommend it without hesitation.,,Sep 2025

I had read the reviews and knew it was not going to be a cheap evening out but all I can say is wow. It was a perfect evening, overlooking the sea and the walls of the City in a great atmosphere and with just the best food.
From the moment you arrive they make you feel welcome and special, you walk in through the entrance and they had a piano player and you are taken to your seat and the service is exceptional. The waiters have white gloves and they really look after you.
I can’t fault anything, the food and the flavours were unbelievable and the cocktails were some of the best we’ve had anywhere. I had scallops for starter and lamb for main and everything was perfect, my wife had the fish and it was cooked to perfection.
A great selection of wines and drinks and the deserts were also amazing.
If you are looking for a restaurant for a special treat then give this place a try, be prepared it’s not cheap but you are paying for an amazing experience and you get it and as a treat to end our week in Dubrovnik it was worth it.",,Aug 2025

Not only did they go out of their way to ensure I had a the most wonderful time with their courteousness and amazing white glove service, but the also went the extra mile by moving closer over looking the water and the most beautiful view of the Adriatic. All of these gestures made my celebration al the more special while supported by the deliciously tasting and creative food, paired perfectly by the most poignant wine suggestion of a local variety, previously unknown to me, trusting their expert suggestion which complimented my meal very specially. They also took extra steps and had extra gesture to provide a portable phone charger to my table as my phones battery was exhausted from taking so many pictures of my beautifully presented food and beautiful settings. 
A very special thanks to Antonio, my server, who was extremely attentive and guided me perfectly to the best and most delicious meal option, also a very special thanks to the sommelier Darko , who suggested the most delicious local wine which was previously unknown to me enhancing the meal just perfectly.

The hospitality of the staff deserves its own review, as does the bar program, and of course, as does the kitchen. 

Damir, the cocktail director is brilliant; curating a cocktail menu just as incredible and expansive as the dinner menu.

Ivan, our server, shines just as bright and only adds to the experience.

The cost was not inexpensive, but very appropriate for the quality of the food, service and experience. Hrvoje really surprised us with “a little something”at the end of our dining experience, and it was an experience, not a meal.

From the moment we sat down, the service was warm, attentive, and genuinely thoughtful. Our waiter was fantastic! Ante was knowledgeable, friendly, and had a great sense of creativity. He told us ""feel at home"" and he did not disappoint.

We started with a Kir Royale, and I have to say, they made it unlike any other place we've tried, It was perfectly balanced, elegant, and refreshing. They lined the rim with honey and used their homemade creme de cassis. We also had the Black Prince, which was just as bold and flavorful as the name suggests.

But the highlight was when I told our waiter I was in the mood for either rakija or gin, and he returned with a custom cocktail that blended both. It was incredible! Totally unexpected and perfectly crafted. That kind of attention and care really made the evening feel special.

If you're in Dubrovnik and want a place that takes pride in both its service and creativity, Nautika is absolutely worth a visit. It's at least 30€ per person but the quality and service is worth it. I made a reservation to celebrate a birthday so we'll definitely be back.",,Jul 2025

It is truly a stunning restaurant. They were very gracious and sat us outside. We were at an elevated table which without reservations we were lucky to get. The prime spots are right at the wall. The view from our table was very good as well. 

We started with lovely cocktails and shared shrimp risotto for a starter. Their bread is delicious. We each had fresh fish that was wonderful. Beautifully plated and presented with garnishes. Service is white glove, professional wait staff. 

 We were seated in front of a couple with their teenage daughter. She was very hyper, and disruptive. The Maitre D saw this and asked if we wanted to move. He took me into the restaurant, which is lovely upstairs to another lovely room, my husband stayed at our table to see if I wanted to move. I decided not to as that patio is absolutely magical. It's nice that they are that attentive and wanting their customers to have the best time. Most places wouldn't even consider doing this.
We saw these people the next night in old town. The girl was jumping on walls and running madly all over. Parents weren't that young, I feel sorry for them. Why they took her to Nautika is unclear. She spent a lot of time wrapped in a blanket and going under the table. No manners at all. Sad.

We spent 4 courses with him and he made our night, we absolutely loved him. It’s our mini honeymoon, so they offered to move us for the final course over to the other side of the patio for the final course and a different viewpoint of the amazing scenery. There, we met Antonio who was clearly an absolute pro. He was funny and personable and made the end to our night so special with some extra desserts and drinks. I cannot tell you how amazing every course is, everything we had was incredible - special mention to the veal cheek. 

I can’t wait to come back next time we’re here for our anniversary!",,Jun 2025

Deirdre G,null,null,3,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,"Disappointed, chef just not up to this price point. We went for our anniversary and got the five course tasting and wine pairing. For over 400E for two, it was just not of the caliber you would expect both in terms of the food and service. The biggest letdown in the service was the wine pairing. We are very interested in wines, and with a wine pairing you usually get enthusiastic and knowledgeable descriptions of the wine with local context, and why it is paired with the specific food. The sommelier never looked us in the eye, just recited a few facts, seemed to be in a rush to get away, basically calling it in instead of trying to make it a nice foodie experience. The bread service was also both odd and underwhelming. They presented a tray of five different flavors of rolls, but all bland with the same texture and softer crust, they looked like they came out of a supermarket. With this they brought olive oil in a bottle and placed it on the table. We didn't see them again for quite a while and we each ate a couple of pieces of bread. Then with the first course they brought a different bottle of olive oil and explained why it was better. They did this with each course, but it made no sense because we had already eaten our fill of bread. Ultimately they brought 4-5 different bottles of olive oil to the table. If this was meant to be an olive oil tasting, they should have stated that at the beginning explaining that they will bring other bottles throughout the meal--we could have saved the bread and tried the different oils-- or they could have brought them all at once and explained the concept. Also, having five bottles on the table doesn't seem very elegant. The food was the biggest problem, nothing memorable/creative at all and nothing showing the marks of a great chef. Usually at a meal like this (and we've done many), the food is surprising, the plating exciting, each course is a joy of culinary discovery. As an example, the beef cheek was presented in a dark gravy, with brown hazelnut mashed potatoes, garnished with a mini carrot that had been fried in a brown crumb coating. The carrot was overcooked, the potatoes confusing (why?), the beef mundane-- no better than any beef cheek I've had in an average priced restaurant. And the all brown plating? It is so fun to discover a new chef and see how they made their mark but this is not that experience and definitely not a place for foodies. We actually liked their sister restaurant Gradska kavana Arsenal far better. We had an ocean front table with just as lovely a view, the bread was far superior, the food/chef was a lot better, the service more warm and on point. The veal I ordered was not only plated more appealingly and professionally, but perfectly cooked and better than any course at Nautika. Our meal there with a great bottle of local wine was $130E for two. Save your money. For a truly one of a kind dining experience try Local in their brand new old town location and watch them cook Peka over an open fire.",,May 2025

We had the Trio Seafood Delicacies, Scallops, Shrimp Risotto and Beef Cheek. All the dishes are presented beautifully but there were some major issues, especially for a restaurant at this price point. The Trio of Seafood was just very plain tasting in the end and not worth the time. The scallop appetizer was the highlight of the meal and definitely something we'd get again. The shrimp risotto was flavorful but the shrimp was peanut sized chopped up pieces of fish, and thus not becoming of a restaurant like this where we'd expect to get nice large shrimps in a dish like this not cut up pieces of shrimp. The worst part was the beef cheek which was so fatty that most of it was inedible and spit out back on to the plate. Upon seeing this, without our complaining at all, they did take that dish off the check. Again, no issues with the service which was great, but too much of the food was a miss and we wouldn't try it again.",,Jul 2024

We had a lovely dinner, and its an absolutely fantastic setting overlooking the sea and one of the Old Town forts. Service is literally white gloved, and the wine “list” weights about 40 kg/20 lbs, more like an encyclopedia (very interesting reading about the wine regions of Croatia). The food is very good, but if you are looking for cutting edge/trendy, look elsewhere. It’s very expensive. We enjoyed our meals, nothing wrong at all….service emphasizes presentation and everything is served with a flourish (or two).

If the portions were twice the size, we could consider them small. Fortunately they serve you quite a lot of bread and oil, but after more than €100 per person, without wine or dessert and sharing a starter... you would have to look for a nearby pizzeria.

Medium-low quality, no balance of flavors not to mention certain preparations. Tiring and out of place also the selection of oils in every course, where the taste went to cover every single dish.

The food was absolutely exquisite from start to finish. We had the 7 course taster menu. Worth every penny. A particular highlight was the tuna, the ox cheeks and the cuttlefish, but it was all good. A nice feature was they brought round a different type of olive oil with each savoury course - a lovely touch!

The wine menu is extremely extensive (about 35 pages long). We had one of the best wines I have ever had, as recommended by the sommelier. 

The staff were incredible and extremely attentive. We mentioned that we wanted to try some local spirits and they served them to us on the house. A lovely and thoughtful touch. 

I definitely recommend booking in advance and requesting the front line on the terrace. You do not want to be in their front garden as it’s very touristy there. 

They have a lovely piano reception as you walk in. The pianist even sang a few songs throughout the night which was lovely.

Ordered a 5-course menu with a customized wine package. The food was a bit variable, from fantastically good dishes (prawns, veal and chocolate dessert) to more disappointing and slightly tasteless fish dishes and a slightly too fancy fish soup. The wine package, on the other hand, was absolutely brilliant, and the waiters' knowledge of both food, drink and Dubrovnik's history, combined with their wonderful mood, made the whole stay a brilliant experience well worth the steep price.

We had amuse-bouches which were divine. One interesting fact came out: The Croations love and are passionate about their olive oil. We were able to sample four different oils with a selection of breads.

Geneviève Jalbert,"Ottawa, Canada",Canada,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"From the moment we stepped into Nautica Restaurant in Dubrovnik, we knew we were about to embark on a culinary journey like no other. Set against the historic backdrop of this UNESCO World Heritage city, Nautica offered us an exquisite dining experience that truly elevated our honeymoon.

The white-glove service was impeccable, striking the perfect balance between attentiveness and discretion. It's not every day that you encounter a team so dedicated to perfection. Our server, in particular, went above and beyond, not only ensuring our dining experience was flawless but also taking the time to capture multiple cherished photographs of us. This personal touch, combined with the expertise of multiple servers guiding and educating us on the array of delectable dishes and crafted cocktails, made us feel like royalty.

The food, as expected, was a symphony of flavors, each dish artfully presented and bursting with freshness and creativity. And while the price point may be on the higher side, every bite justified the expense. As they say, you get what you pay for, and at Nautica, we were served nothing short of excellence.

In a city renowned for its dining experiences, Nautica stands out not just for its outstanding cuisine, but for the passion and dedication of its staff. Our evening there wasn't just a meal; it was an event, an experience, a memory we will cherish forever.

For those contemplating a visit, our advice is simple: treat yourself. Whether it's a special occasion like ours or simply the desire for an unmatched dining experience, Nautica Restaurant in Dubrovnik is well worth the splurge. Here's to an evening of sheer perfection by the Adriatic! 🍷🍴🌊 Book a reservation as this is a Michelin guide restaurant and you won't be able to just walk-in as it's high demand and books up fast.",,Aug 2023

This was seen in the service - first manager greets and introduces the waitor, then they had separate serves for carrying the food, you were also guided for the toilettes. For us this took a bit away from the experience as the restaurant felt too stiff and conservative. So if you want a relaxed dinner, I would recommend some other place, but if you are fine with upper class style of place then recommended to try this place.

However the experience feels a little ‘try too hard’ rather than naturally good customer service.

Bxm86,"East Longmeadow, Massachusetts",USA,4,null,null,null,null,"I have to be honest in these reviews even though establishment wouldn’t agree with me. 5 of us dined in one of the most romantic restaurants in world. The restaurant’s romantic atmosphere has drawn celebrity couples including Hollywood royalty (Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell) and actual royalty (Prince and Princess Akishino of Japan and the king and queen of Norway). The day before we were there Magic Johnson dined with them. First thing first if truly want to enjoy the romantic atmosphere then only dine at the table outside on the first floor by the wall. We dined at 3rd floor outside and we didn’t feel that romantic atmosphere.

Second is the food part. We were so excited to be able to make a reservation at this place but at the end we overhyped ourselves and we left with a disappointment. Trust the other reviewers who say; “Incredibly overpriced, tiny portions, left extremely hungry.” We did a la carte but that’s the wrong way to go. You have to do the 5 course to fill your stomach. We ordered different things such as sea bass, lamb, and few other main dishes. We tried each other foods and to be honest we didn’t feel like this was a Michelin star meal. Portions were small because their menu is planned as a 5 course meal. When I say this and we are not kidding but the best tasting food here was the fresh bread and the dessert plate they offered (complimentary). I think that sums up the food review pretty well.

If you ever want to dine at this place make sure to dine like celebrities and sit on the table by the wall/water. Also do the 5 course meal. Otherwise you are not truly getting that experience.",,Aug 2023
DLNY,sutton in ashfield,sutton in ashfield,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"We visited NAUTIKA on the last evening of our stay on the 9th August as part of our 20th wedding anniversary celebrations. I was unable to book a table on the front terrace for the actual day(2nd August) even when booking in January of this year! So please do not leave booking to the last minute as you're most likely be disappointed. Having not being been able to book the 2nd, this was probably a blessing in disguise as our experience here just rounded off our perfect stay in Croatia(we were staying at the Kompass Hotel in Lapad).

So to our Experience(not just a meal) on their 6:30pm sunset sitting.
From standing outside this fabulous building before entering which was once a former Sailors school, to our sad departure we had an absolutely wonderful time. 
Tomaslav & his team have the perfect balance of being professional & friendly in equal measures.
On being met at the entrance & walked up the red carpeted steps into the elegant lounge area we were certainly made to feel very 'special'.
We were then shown to our table(30) WOW, WOW, WOW!! Right on the very corner... what a truly spectacular & romantic setting.. Above & beyond our expectations.
Even the atmosphere & vibes of the whole restaurant are so relaxed & comforting

The food.. we opted to chose from the a la carte menu rather than the set menu.. sublime food throughout every course, with service.to match. 
 'Tomato cloud' Amuse bouche.. Mmmmm ..I could have eaten this all night!! Starters - My wife had scallops & I chose mushroom in pasta, both sprinkled with fresh truffle.

Mains - Both of us had the fillet steak, cooked medium & to perfection

Desserts - One raspberry & white chocolate mouse & one cheese cake which we shared, as you would.

All of this whilst sipping an excellent local sparkling Rose wine(Jagunic) from, in our opinion 'The Best table on the terrace' looking out at the Old City Walls & the sea... Lost for words.

On finishing our meal we were not rushed at all & retired to the lounge area where we were served complimentary after dinner drinks whilst listening to the excellent pianist, which just added to our already exceptional evening.

In summary:
When visiting the Old Town do not hesitate in booking the Nautika but remember to book well in advance as there are different areas/terraces to choose from, the front row tables where we were get booked up first for the obvious reason of the views.

It isn't cheap, but you only live once don't you, so save up & splash out! We're both positive that you will not be disappointed 

Thanks once again ALL at the Nautika for a truly memorable experience

Wine list is impressive as you would expect, Amuse bouche was like a savoury meringue which was a fantastic start. The starters were wonderful but spoilt by the lashings of truffle (see pictures) which for us were just too much. Main course tuna was lovely, sea bass flavours didn’t work for us however the pralines selection at the end was, like the Amuse Bouche simply wonderful.

Evan C,null,null,1,null,null,null,null,"Where do I even begin with this disastrous dinner experience? From start to finish, it was an absolute catastrophe that left me with a profound sense of disappointment and a longing for the meal I could have had elsewhere.

Let's start with the ambiance. The restaurant boasted an elegant decor, but the atmosphere was anything but pleasant. The lighting was excessively dim, making it difficult to read the menu or see the abysmal food that was served. The noise level was deafening, making it impossible to hold a conversation without shouting. It was like dining in a chaotic cafeteria rather than an establishment that supposedly prided itself on fine dining.

The service was an absolute joke. The staff seemed disinterested and disengaged, as if they were doing us a favor by taking our orders. Our drinks took an eternity to arrive, and when they did, they were lukewarm at best. We had to repeatedly ask for simple requests, like utensils and napkins, which should have been readily available. It was as if the concept of attentive service was completely foreign to them.

Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered a supposedly ""signature dish"" that was recommended by the waiter, and it turned out to be an absolute disaster. The presentation was unappetizing, with sloppy plating that looked like it had been thrown together in a hurry. The taste was even worse. The meat was overcooked and tough, lacking any discernible flavor. The accompanying sides were bland and uninspiring, as if they were an afterthought. It was a dish that lacked any culinary finesse or creativity.

My dining companions fared no better. One had ordered a seafood pasta, which arrived cold and was swimming in an excessively oily sauce. The seafood itself was chewy and tasted stale. Another friend ordered a vegetarian option and was shocked to find that it consisted of a pile of undercooked vegetables that lacked seasoning or any depth of flavor.

To add insult to injury, the prices were exorbitant for the quality of the food and service we received. It felt like we were being charged for a five-star experience when we were served a meal that would be better suited for a cheap fast-food joint.

In conclusion, this dinner was an unmitigated disaster from start to finish. The lackluster service, unappetizing food, and inflated prices made it an experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. Save yourself the disappointment and seek out a different dining option where you can actually enjoy a satisfying meal and receive the service you deserve.",,Jul 2023

Nothing like this type of call to ruin the start of your evening when you realize you'd entered the wrong time in your calendar. I explained that to Petra and asked if we should still come...at 7:30pm. She was so gracious. ""Yes, please do. You have your table (front row by the sea) until 9:15pm and if you're having desert at that time, please enjoy it in our inside seating area."" We hurried and were seated at 7:30. I apologized to the manager and Mauro, our server. Within moments we were served drinks and appetizers as we gazed out at the beautiful view from our table. Four different olive oils were presented...one for each course. Each dish was sumptuous and creative in presentation. Mauro was efficient (he had to be as we were one hour late), friendly and engaging. At dessert (interestingly at 9:15pm, I offered to move from our table as I knew it was assigned but Mauro insisted, ""No, sir. We've enjoyed having you. Please stay as long as you'd like."" This was honestly a surprise as every table on the front row had indeed been turned. He then brought us Croatian dessert wine compliments of himself. I asked for the manager, complimented the entire experience and asked why they didn't have a Michelin star (or 2) and he was gracious, saying their focus is their customer. Well done, Nautika team.

R K L,"Seattle, Washington",USA,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"Arguably one of only several which should be considered the finest restaurant in Dubrovnik, Nautika Restaurant was the definition of elegant dining at its finest. Reservations to garner a table on the terrace with incredible views of the Adriatic Sea and Fort Lovrijenac were a must. The ambience in this beautifully-restored mansion was replete with live piano music suitable for the space and decor. 

It should come as no surprise that the food was beyond amazing. They made it very easy to order by providing tasting menu options with both five and seven courses. We opted for two of each to allow for the maximum tasting experience. However, should we have chosen to be more adventurous, we could also have cherry picked from their a la carte options which were extensive. Several bottles of the Posip Intrada were an uncomplicated pairing and excellent. It was truly a magnificent dining experience in Dubrovnik, but be forewarned that such excellence came at a price. The evening outing for four before gratuity was 825.99 euro...but definitely worth the price!",,Oct 2022

Based on stellar reviews, I chose Nautika and booked it months in advance. Once we arrived, someone downplayed it, which made me hesitate for a moment. But we stuck with it, for which I’m thrilled because it was the crown jewel of our tour of the Balkans! We were seated in the second row from the wall, which was beautiful, facing the illuminated St. Lawrence with amazing views of the Adriatic. The service was top notch, white glove service across the board. Our cocktails were imaginative and theatrically presented. The food was sublime across the board. Like most people, I don’t mind paying a lot for truly good cuisine but despise feeling ripped off. Don’t worry because Nautika delivered. I was ready for an upscale meat dish. The steak was cooked to perfection and the accompaniments were lovely. Dessert was a work of art and the wine with our entrees sealed my new love for Croatian reds. We marveled at the service.

I'm guessing your wondering why I gave the food 9.5/10 portion size only, its a MICHELIN star restaurant small portion are normal but I would of love 2 more lamb pieces as they were so good. 

We had the Shrimps and Scallop hot starters with the Lobster Tail & Lamb Dalmatia for our main and it all was fabulous. 

They have a great wine selection (over 600) but I personally order the cocktail which I loved.

Mark’s knowledge of the menu and the roots of all ingredients was impressive, and he was able to make excellent recommendations based on our preferences. We tried the tasting menu, and each one was better than the last (literally.. the desert was the best desert I’ve ever had) The seafood was incredibly fresh and expertly prepared, and the flavours were truly outstanding. It was clear that the chefs take great pride in their work and use only the finest ingredients.

But it wasn't just the food that made this dining experience so memorable - it was the entire atmosphere. The restaurant is located by the Adriatic Sea and we could hear the waves crashing down as we enjoyed our evening. The staff were all friendly and attentive and the sommelier was knowledgeable and candid, making us feel welcomed and cared for.

chimayred,"Durham, New Hampshire",USA,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,null,"we wanted to pull out the stops for one super dinner in Croatia. This sounded like the right thing. Had great reviews. Voted one of the most romantic restaurants in the world. What could possibly go wrong?
In fact, nothing. It was sensational start to finish. Now our guide that day, who livedin Montenegro and had lived in DUbrovnik, volunteered that he didn't htink it was worth the money. That was the only thing we disagreed with him about that day!
With a place like this, it is about many factors. Price, service, food prep, wine list, setting. We've eaten at a handful of similar places - The French Laundry in California, Scholteshof in Stevoort Belgium (sadly a thing of the past); Commander's palace in New Orleans, Post Rio in SF; Le Bec Fin in Philadelphia, and Castle Treyne in France...This was solidly up there in competition with these.
First of all, the service was masterful. our main waiter was Ivan, whose English was perfect. He was very affable, immediately noticed and struck up a conversation about my camera. Additionally, our beverages were served by the sommelier and the recommendations were spot on. Bread and water were constantly being replenished; the bread was world class excellent, and this isn't just filler food; with the sauces and the olive oils supplied, you needed something to get every drop.
Speaking of olive oils, this was the first and only place i've ever been that featured an olive oil progression. They served us at least 4 local olive oils of varying complexity and what a great idea. Hence the enormous amount of bread consumed. 
We got aperol spritzes to start and a bottle of award winning local sauv blanc which i found to be superior to many of the california and new zealand standards; it was less sour and more flinty and minerally and we loved it.
We both opted for the five course tasting menu. It was about $130 euro; this place wasn't cheap. If we had ordered a la carte it would probably have topped $200 a person just for food, and the dishes were all part of the a la carte menu anyway. This was pushing molecular gastronomy; there were a few very small but superb courses. The soup course was ample; the dessert was marvelous. 
Although guide books continue to insist that tipping is unnecessary in Croatia, we asked Ivan if this was the case and he said no; they expected a tip; our total bill including drinks and wine came to $420 US.
Did I say that our table was adjacent to the wall overlooking the Adriatic, with the walls of Dubrovnik a hundred feet away and Fort Lovrijenac a hundred feet to the right. 
Here's the tasting menu from their website:
Tuna Tartare
slightly smoked tuna, orange chutney, wasabi mayonnaise, lemon, bruschette
Fish Soup
white fish mosaic, parsley fluid, mussels
Shrimps
semolina gnocchi, beurre blanc, parsley cream, almonds
White Fish Fillet
served on a bed of cherry tomatoes and young spinach leaves, olive oil and vanilla cream
Chocolate
chocolate, hazelnut, gold
Would we recommend it for a splurge? Definitely. NO regrets.",,Apr 2023

As you’d expect at a gourmet spot like this service was provided by tuxedo clad, white gloved servers with their minion of assistants. Our waiter Maro took excellent care of us and helping with our choices. The food is as artful as it is flavorful with explosions of flavors and textures. The amuse buche was a “tomato cloud”-a melt in your mouth merengue with a dollop of tomatoey flavor on top. For starters my wife had the warming carrot and apple soup while I had the prawns with gnocchi and almonds. Each was a modest size but packed with flavor. We decided to split the sea bass as our main served with toasted pine nuts and tiny roasted tomatoes. For dessert the chocolate which resembled an over side ferra roche chocolate with a creamy hazelnut filling.

There were also some tiny handmade chocolates from the kitchen and as a special treat another plate and a local liquor to commemorate our anniversary. The wi e list features over 600 choices so best to rely on the knowledgeable sommelier.

Christoph1987,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",United Arab Emirates,4,null,null,null,null,"I only am giving this 4 stars and not 3 because of the location, the fantastic white glove service and the level of detail and passion on the service side.

On background I travel a lot and very frequently dine in one star michelin in Europe, US and Asia.

I had the 7 course menu and the execution and presentation in short description must be described as dull and unimaginative.

For a 170 euro tasting menu, a baisser with ketchup is Not a satisfactory amuse bouche.

The „carpaccio „ was a single slice of beef topped with chiffonade and croutons. That was very outdated and bland. The balsamic pearls didnt save it, underseasoned too.

Bisque was very flavorful but not strained and could have been hotter, the caviar atop of crustacean tartar had dried up and too mustve been pre prepped as part of afternoon mice en place.

The best course was the tuna with shaved fennel followed by a main course that i have had on regular banquet dinners. Do something hearty here like sous vide or slow cooked croatian/dalmation lamb or beef.

Dessert was ice cold and heavily pre prepped awkwardly served with a salty waver. Its cold on the terrace. Serve something with hot cold and warm components.

I feel the place could thrive under a fresher and more up to date menu and execution. Get relevant and creative.

I would likely try all the other fine dining locations in Dubrovnik before i give this one a try again.",,Sep 2022

TravelWriter74,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"We are a family of 5, with 3 teenagers and we booked Nautika on recommendation and when we arrived we were not disappointed. It is simply a stunning building and the whole ambience is gorgeous. As you would expect at a high end restaurant you are warmly greeted and we were shown to sofa area for pre dinner drinks. an array of fancy cocktails presented in a somewhat theatre style was well received and we waited patiently for our table. One of the recommendations of the restaurant was the amazing view, probably in fact better during the day for lunch (We booked dinner) but nonetheless we were expecting to be on the main terrace which had a great vibe, candlelight and buzzing from the chatter. Instead we were taken upstairs to a balcony area, which did not have the view and was very small, still laid up beautifully but definitely felt like an overflow area. Big disppointment. We voiced as such as were told that the terrace was fully booked (we booked ourselves of course) but apparently others had booked before we had (clearly not able to confirm or deny such a claim) but the option was eat here or not at all.
The meal itself was wonderful, service was excellent (despite being in overflow !) food is fancy and delicious and wine and overall evening was lovely. They took the cocktails from the bill as a sort of apology for our disappointment over the location. Overall it gets a 5* from me as we are rating the food, service and ambience which was all excellent, but just still a bit disappointed that I feel we didnt get the full Nautika experience that others downstairs did.",,Aug 2022

All of the seats outside offer exceptional views of the Fortress and the Adriatic Sea. The food and service match the equally impressive views. The cuisine is focused on local ingredients with a Croatian influence. Everything we ate was at its peak freshness and it’s very obvious the restaurant takes pride in curating the local olive oils, wines and spices to select only the finest. We went with two kids and the restaurant was very accommodating in offering kids entrees like pasta, grilled chicken breast, steak, etc. We enjoyed the beetroot salad, the truffle tortellini and a whole grilled Dentex. The restaurant grilled the whole fish and then table side deboned and filleted the fish. We really didn’t have room for dessert and the restaurant still came by with petit fours so we could leave on a sweet note. I will also note that prior to this restaurant, our experience with Croatian wines was a little hit or miss.

James L,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"It was 8 weeks ago that I last ate in this amazing restaurant. Already I've returned with some friends for what I know will be an amazing meal tomorrow evening. 

I did create a minor complication. Without the help of Antonelo and Diana, this minor issue could have turned into a disaster; let me explain.

My wife is also in Dubrovnik on a separate holiday with her Mother. Not wanting to miss out on the delights of this wonderful town, I also booked my own accommodation with a few friends at the same time. Of course I could have spent the entire weekend with my Mother-in-law (MIL), but I doubt I'd have survived long enough to return to this restaurant. Divorce a possibility...murder not outside of the realms of imagination (her mother is a strong woman)

Subsequently I had to balance the desperate urge to return to your establishment, whilst also avoiding my MIL. Antonelo and Diana instantly realised my plight and helped me in securing a booking tomorrow evening at 6:30pm - many days after my Wife and MIL's earlier dinner.

Thank you again guys. Your service is always excellent, and now I can say discrete. As the ancient Greeks would say ""mater mea est in lege mentis""",,Jul 2022

Our main waitress Tihana was so friendly, knowledgable and kind. We came away from the evening feeling like we’d made a friend! :-)
My boyfriend had the 7 course taster menu, photos attached. We’ve had many a fancy meal before but he says it wins the award for the best meal he’s ever eaten.
Due to being 6 months pregnant there are various foods I need to avoid at the moment and Tihana and her team were so accommodating with helping me find options on the menu. I had scallops for starter, sea bass for main and the most amazing chocolate hazelnut dessert. 
We also loved all the olive oil pairings - !
The cocktails (and mocktails for me) were beautiful and were presented so wonderfully (pics also attached).
The whole experience was culinary genius and we feel lucky to have tried it.
We are in Croatia celebrating our Babymoon (last holiday as two before our baby arrives in October) and also our 5 Year Anniversary. We were brought special complimentary cocktails at the end of the night and also a lovely pink rose for me to take home.
We can’t recommend this special restaurant enough and would like to thank all the staff and chefs at Nautika for an amazing experience.

After doing my research I decided Nautika would definitely be special. First let me say thank you to Jan Prebisalic head concierge at the Hilton hotel. I contacted Jan and asked him if he could make our reservation. We requested a front row table and he said he would do his best. We received a response later saying that Nautika could reserve a table for us on the second row. That was fine because it is such a beautiful restaurant and the location is unbeatable. When we arrived at the restaurant we couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. Even if you aren’t dining there you should walk by to see it. We arrived at the restaurant and the hostess said that they were able to move us up to the front row.Little did we know I think she seated us at the best table on the terrace! The view of the forts is absolutely amazing and we were fortunate enough to have a full moon reflecting off of the ocean.
We were seated and it was like stepping back in time where waiters wore red jackets and white gloves. It’s truly an experience. Our wine sommelier suggest a local red wine and it was absolutely delicious.
We ordered our entrees and just sat and starred at the view.

I was happy to just sit down and have a sensational view on the very last night of my unforgettable vacation in Croatia. Moro (sp?) was my waiter and listened to my plea for a light menu, assisting me in a perfect selection of a beetroot salad as a starter followed by the Ahi tuna. He brought 3 different olive oil selections, giving me background on each (I later bought one at the store across the way) and selected a perfect local white wine to pair with the meal. The food was excellent, the setting was a ""10"", the weather was perfection and the moon was full. The only thing that was missing was someone to share it with...so I'm sharing it with YOU!

The staff were wonderful and moved us to a less “busy” part of the terrace…..absolutely perfect and a very romantic setting. We opted for the 7 course tasting menu which was out of this world. Couldn’t fault a single course and it was cooked and presented to a very high standard. Just what you would expect from a fine dining restaurant….if not more. I believe this restaurant is featured in the Michelin guide but not yet awarded its first Michelin star….I genuinely don’t think it will be long before they gain this recognition. Having dined at a few “starred” restaurants in London this place really does deserve that accreditation. It isn’t cheap, but you’ll know that from checking the website, however I can say wholeheartedly that it was worth every penny for the food, experience, location and service.

As a solo traveler, I often get the worst table, but they gave me the center table on their famous terrace, overlooking the bay. As I got seated, I was attended to by 3 waiters who made sure that I was comfortable. After I settled, they helped me pick a cocktail to kick off the evening (Bird in a Cage) which I LOVED. I then wanted to order a bottle of blanc de blancs, knowing I will not finish it but wanted it since it was my birthday (they didn't know) but the sommelier gently suggested that I order a particular brand by the glass instead since it tasted just like blanc de blancs - and he was right! I chose the Foie Gras appetizer which was spectacular and on par with (if not better than) the Foie Gras I had in Paris last month – the temp of the Fois Gras was perfect and the accompaniments accentuated the delicate flavor. For main, I chose veal which was delectable. And I never had to ask for anything as the waiter magically appeared when I needed something. It was a truly memorable birthday dinner - if Nautika can make a person feel this special on a special day (without knowing about my birthday) on a random weekday in August during a crazy heatwave, then they have clearly mastered the art of immaculate dining experience. Croatia is a casual place, but if you want to be treated like a royalty with the warmth that is inherent in Croatians - Nautika is your place.",,Aug 2021

I have gluten allergy (celiac) and the staff was so accommodating I could hardly believe it. Both times the server confidently told me they could prepare anything gluten free and was aware of the severity of the allergy. They brought out fresh baked gluten free bread, the best I have ever seen. If you are gluten free you know how bad gluten free bread usually is if it’s even offered. This bread looked so good I waited to make sure and ask before eating it because I thought it might be regular bread. Although the lobster typically comes with pasta, they were able to substitute it and it was perfect. They even baked me an extra batch of bread to take home.

How this restaurant has no michelin star is beyond me. We visitied 360 restaurant four days later and not one single aspect of the restaurant was better. 
We have visited several michelin starred resaurants from all around europe. This is equal if not superior to all of them.
Honestly do not miss out on this as you are i for a real treat.

Xanthe J,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,We visited the restaurant a few days ago as a special occasion meal for my 25th birthday on our last night in Dubrovnik. The service was amazing - the staff couldn’t do enough for you and were so kind and explained all the ingredients and the origins. We shared the truffle tagliatelle to start - generous helpings of truffle and you could tell the pasta was homemade and so fresh - a little al dente which was great. I ordered the sea bass which was so tender and cooked beautifully on a bed of well seasoned vegetables and a delicious corn blend type mash. My partner had the lamb which he claimed was the best lamb he’s ever had - so tender and moist. Throughout the meal they brought homemade fresh bread with a variety of Croatian olive oils which we were told the history of. The wine list is extensive - we sampled alongside some cocktails - I had the spicy mojito which was good but not the best - could’ve been stronger and spicer. The negroni was served theatrically in a slim jug which was swirled around then poured - my partner enjoyed throughly. We were brought a range of complimentary chocolates with the bill - they were amazing - we were told they were also made in house which was a fantastic touch - I would’ve bought a whole box of the white chocolate with a praline filling. All in all - a great venue for special occasions or when in Dubrovnik for a truly sensational experience.,,Aug 2020

The very location recommends Nautika for a special evening: view and atmosphere are outstanding and create the perfect setting for fine dining. The tasteful décor of the restaurant and the highly professional staff create a cultivated framework for the excellent cuisine. F&B Manager Tomislav Lonac had the kindness to show around and explain the design considerations - justly proud of the distinguished restaurant he himself was a true representative of.
Placed on the terrace on a warm October evening, we had chosen the 5-course fish menu with accompanying wines - and this proved a perfect choice indeed, excellent to the very detail. The service and information given by our evening's host Valentino on the Croatian wines, olive oils, the individual dishes was outstanding; we together enjoyed an unusually pleasant 'food experts' discussion of ingredients and potential variations.

We all ordered the 7 course tasting menu. Our favourites were the beef carpaccio and the veal, both of which were utterly delicious. The spicy tomato sauce alongside the cuttlefish was perhaps not our favourite, and for me the tuna with fennel 3 ways not my favourite (I don't like fennel, apparently!).

Dessert was exceedingly sweet, and my two friends didn't eat it as it was just ""too much"" - our waiter insisted on providing us with a replacement which really was a generous gesture.

Our wines were delicious, an istrian Malvazija was particularly enjoyable. 

Our meal finished with a complementary liqueur (choice of cherry, plum or carob bean -yum!).

The service was second to none, just the right amount of attentiveness. Particular thanks to our own waiter Mario, although at times we had 4 people serving us! The live piano music was very enjoyable too.

Tre W,"York, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"My other half booked this for us weeks before we were due to go on holiday, we had a side terrace seat overlooking the fort, it was stunning. 
The staff are so lovely and very helpful especially when it comes to the wine bible, it is huge, but if you explain what you like they can recommend the best options. 
The menu isn’t massive but I always think this is a good thing, everything on it looked amazing. 
Various olive oils from different regions were paired with the bread, and other courses, which I thought was a lovely touch and were some of the best oils I’ve had.
To start we had a complimentary amuse bouche which was lovely.
We then had the bisque and the risotto to start and then the lobster and the sea bass all of which was amazing, super fresh and perfectly cooked and the presentation was wonderful, for dessert we had the trio of chocolate, which was so lovely. 
After dessert we were moved to one of the prime tables that had become free which I thought was a lovely touch as these tables are usually booked up 3-6 months in advance. The waiters offer to take your picture and have no issues taking many and from different angles too, nothing is too much trouble for them.
The evening was rounded off with a complimentary glass of traditional liqueur, it’s super strong. 
This is truly a beautiful restaurant, with stunning food and wonderful staff, I can’t recommend it enough.",,Sep 2019

Ivan was our waiter and he was flawless. My husband got the seven course tasting menu and I did the five course so we could try as much as possible. We also each did wine pairings. I still cannot believe how good the wine in Croatia is. 

Our favorites were the shrimps served on polenta and the tuna steak. If you do the tasting menu I highly recommend the wine pairing as well because each wine took the food to another level.

It is located just outside the walls of the old town but in a great spot overlooking the sea. It has seating inside and out but you need to be seated out side to take in the views and atmosphere. If you can book well in advance and get the tables that immediately look over the sea but I imagine they are hard to come by if not the other tables outside are lovely too.
We had the Croatian Tomac champagne which was excellent and compared to the more expensive branded champagne a bargain at £100. The sommelier was excellent who gave us some great advice of what wine to have and the background on it. The service was excellent which believe me in most Croatian Hotels and restaurants is hard to find especially with a smile on their faces. We were then taken through the menu which was five star especially when you bear in mind that I have eaten in many fancy restaurants in London. Price wise compared to London around the same but cheaper than the many fancy restaurants that we have again in London.
Nice touches inside too with the decor and pianist.

heeledandhungry,"New York City, New York",USA,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"Nautika was on my list before we even got to Dubrovnik, but we kind of ended up there on the fly. We were jumping off cliffs at Buza Bar about midday and figured we'd stop by Nautika for late lunch after (for some reason I relied on a review that listed this place as ""casual dining""). Unfortunately, they don't serve lunch. Fortunately, they didn't judge us when we showed up a bit later for dinner in day-time SUPER casual attire (my boyfriend was still in his banana print swim shorts and non-matching tee) and gave us a table, because this was an experience we couldn't have possibly missed! It's a casual experience masked as a fine dining restaurant in the best way possible - the food and ambiance rival any Michelin starred restaurant I've ever been to around the world, but the staff is so unpretentious, fun-loving and relaxed that you feel completely at ease.

We were seated at 6pm and were told that dinner would last about 2.5 hours. They offer both an a la carte menu and 2 tasting menus - we generally prefer to share a bunch of dishes so we actually tried a bit more than the tasting menu was offering and ordered exactly what we wanted for about the same price. We started with cocktails, which they take very seriously - the presentation is impeccable and despite the fact that this place is a white tablecloth fine dining spot, they don't judge you for ""doin it for the gram"" in the least. Our server Martin was absolutely fantastic. He gave us phenomenal recommendations, was very light (unlike what you'd expect at a fine dining venue) and we truly could've spent the whole night chatting with him.

Here's what we ordered, and we loved it all:
- Homemade Fish Soup
- Shrimp Served on Polenta
- Adriatic Scallops
- Seabass Filet
- Lamb Dalmatian Style

Travel on my Mind,"Rochester, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,null,"We decided to treat ourselves to dinner here on a recent visit to Dubrovnik – the eye-watering prices mean that it is not somewhere you will eat every night, but for me it was worth every Kuna.

Firstly the location is stunning just outside the City Walls with all outside tables having a sea view. Before dinner we sat on the terrace and had a smoky mojito which for me was even better than the original Cuban classic thanks to the smoked sugar and hint of lavender. For starters, I had the Prawns with Goats Cheese and Almonds on Polenta – I have to say I was a bit sceptical about this dish as on paper shellfish paired with a strong goats cheese and nuts sounds a bit of a strange combination. Happy to report though that the chef proved me wrong as it was delicious with all the flavours working really well together.

For the main, I had the veal fillet in a wine sauce served with truffled potato gratin. Again the cooking was on point as the truffle did not over-power the rest of the dish and the veal was extremely tender. The OH had the beef fillet which again was cooked to perfection. All of this was washed down with a bottle of the local Posip wine. The wait staff were fantastic taking time to explain the dishes and the wine and our glass was never empty. Another nice touch was that each dish was paired with a local olive oil whose origins again were all expertly explained by the wait team.

As mentioned this place is by no means cheap, but I figure that you have to treat yourself once in a while, especially on holiday, and the cooking and ingredients are without doubt of a very high standard. Would definitely recommend.",,Jun 2019

As Australians we prefer our meat a lot less done- the lamb and veal were still tender- but we prefer them pink.

Most notable was our waiter Martin’s expertise, he seemed to know exactly what we wanted and when. 

One of us had a starter but they gave both of us plates to enjoy it as it was so nice, the effort they made presenting it was enough to tempt us both into having a glass of wine with this course too, which we didn’t regret as it complemented the dish very well. 

Sea bass and fillet of beef for mains were outstanding, again along with the matched wine. 

Also received good guidance on desserts and matched wines. It’s clear they’re not trying to get you to go for the more expensive wines either, they just want you to have the best possible experience. 

Aside from the food, the piano player, toiletries and scenery were all of standards you’d expect in a Michelin star restaurant. Perhaps this restaurant isn’t far away from receiving this honour.",,Jul 2019
Adrian P,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"We visited this restaurant whilst on holiday, having pre booked an outside terrace table from the UK. It's a lovely spot, next to the city walls with views of the sea. Be prepared to pay for the experience, as it's expensive but it's worth it as a holiday memory and for the quality.
We opted for the 7 course taster menu, accompanied by a local wine and were not disappointed:
Food - high quality, perfectly presented; loved it all, especially the shrimp soup;
Wine - we went with a reasonably priced bottle of white, representative of the region, as recommended by the sommelier to accompany our taster menu;
Location/ambience - lovely romantic spot, with nice lighting on the castle and city walls when the sun goes down;
Service - I have to say our senior waiter for the evening was impeccable! ... knows his job, but equally, if not more important, made us feel welcome and at ease;
And finally, an unexpected surprise was when my partner returned to our table following a visit to the facilities, to tell me that the music and songs we'd been listening to through the terrace speakers all evening was not recorded, but live... the singer/musician was that good!",,Jul 2019

Stuart M,London,London,5,null,null,null,null,"First of all a tip - they do two primary sittings, at 6.30 and 9.30, which will get you the best seats. If you make a request outside of these times they can accommodate you further back, but they will email you to check whether that is want. I didn’t spot the email so lost the reservation, however managed to get in after requesting to be waitlisted and they called us back following some cancellations on the day. Apparently cancellations are fairly common so definitely worth asking to be waitlisted if need be.

Secondly, it is undoubtedly expensive-especially the starters, which are probably most expensive I have seen anywhere - more than £30 for a beef carpaccio, albeit a good one.

However, those minor gripes/difficulties aside, it is a magnificent restaurant. The photos illustrate the setting, with beautiful views over both fort and city walls. The food is arguably better - each course, from amuse bouche to dessert, got better (and all but dessert served with its own Croatian olive oil, which was a touch I enjoyed!) Flavour combinations are ambitious but perfectly executed, with meats cooked to perfection.

Finally, service was friendly and attentive throughout, and they even through in two post dinner cocktails for us to celebrate our anniversary-thanks!!",,Jul 2019

Dave L,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,3.0,4.0,5.0,null,"The service was excellent, the view outstanding, the food very good and it was a memorable experience. But it is expensive. E.g. Over 1000 Kuna per person (£125). We had the same sort of food quality, possibly even better, at Restaurant More, for less than half the price for 3 courses and a bottle of wine per couple. Not quite as spectacular a view, but still great, and service not quite as full on professional, but still a great experience. And we thought better overall value for money.
Also, the Nautika sister restaurant, Panorama has even more spectacular views than Nautika and you can do lunch there for a quarter of the price. 
One service irritation about Nautika was that we were not told about the 10% discount at sister restaurants. Panorama gave us a 10% discount as we'd eaten at Nautika, without us asking. And we were not offered chocolates and after dinner liqueurs at Nautika whereas the moaners at the table near us were.

As every meal looked interesting and good we took the 7 course tasting menu, and it was a great harmony of dishes, mixture of fish and meat. The plates looked deserving of a Michelin star.
We were amazed by the wine list, which is literally a book, not a list. So many good wines, and different years of good wines.
The service was impecable, from the manager, to the sommelier and our great waiter.

The 5-course tasting menu gave us a great variety of dishes to sample--with some additional touches offered by the restaurant. This restaurant deserves Michelin star as it is the best restaurant we tried on our trip through Croatia.

I must say they have the most perfect , the most amazing, stunning wine list my husband has ever seen and ,believe me, he is big wine lover.

My drink was served in a bird cage (inspired by the swallows you'll see twirling and diving over the water as you eat) and scattered with rose petals.

What a delight, we had a wonderful table on the 3rd level over looking the bay and the old walls and buildings. 
So many opportunities for photos, all the area lit up after dark giving us even more shots. 
The food was like a piece of art. My wife’s Mini Garden Soup was a picture. Amazing mini garden dressed around the outside of the plate. My Tagliettelli sprinkled with shavings of black truffle was divine and I could have had this as a main course. 
We both fancied the sea bass fillet served on a bed of cherry tomatoes and young spinach leaves. The topping of vanilla cream just enhanced the overall delicious flavours. 
We decided to share the pudding, A Raspberry Queen which also hit the mark. 
We were made to feel special which is special as this often does not happen in Fine Dining establishments. 
All the staff at some time seemed to have come to our table. But the main guys were brilliant and the Sommelier was a delight with a great sense of humour.
All told a wonderful experience but at a price. We enjoy fine dining and appreciate the hard work and artistry that goes into the preparation, some others may not. We had 2 courses and shared a pudding course. A G&T a glass of special sparkly rose and a glass of white wine. 
It was better than I expected price wise for the special place and food. 
A 5 course set menu is 820kn and the 7 course 920 s for this quality of food it’s equivalent to around £100 for 5 courses and £120 for the 7 courses which appears good value.

But we decided to sit downstairs on the open terrace with an amazing view of the Dubrovnik bay. Since we got there late, there were only free tables in the second row but we still had a great view. We got recommendations for great local wine and also food (you must try the dessert with the chocolate trio!). But what was outstanding was the service. There were several most nice and polite waiters around us, trying to make everything perfect. Yes this place is expensive. Is it worth it? Yes! Will we come back? Hell yes.

We ended the meal with the Chocolate Fantasy, which was to die for. It was a dark chocolate with cream on the side. Pure Decadent!
I am a non drinker, and the server made me a virgin cocktail, which had a hint of Rose essence, mint, lime juice and ginger.
It was delicious, and it was presented so spectacularly well.
Mario was our server, and he was amazing in guiding us what was the best, the different varieties of olive oils that we tasted.
Fantastic service by all our servers.

It is an elegant place, exquisitely appointed, where we enjoyed a fabulous meal in an outstanding location. We had a table on the terrace close to the railing, overlooking the picturesque Adriatic Sea. We got there just before sunset, and although sunset that evening was curtailed due to cloudy conditions, the short display of color in the sky made for an incredible view. Our waiter was so friendly, and so helpful. The manager came over to greet us, and the wine steward brought us our wine and decanted it - all of them shared with us tidbits of information about the location, the region, and the culture, but not in any kind of intrusive way. The meal was excellent. After a delightful amuse bouche, I had scallops with truffle shavings, and my husband had prawns in a delicious sauce. For mains, I had an excellent steak and my husband had lamb chops - all prepared perfectly and served with inventive vegetables. We had a Plavac Mali wine, which was a great compliment to our food. And, although we had no room for dessert, our waiter returned with complimentary aperitifs and a small tray of chocolates. The restaurant's interior is also very elegant. Just inside the door a pianist played during the evening, with the sound carrying out to the terrace and providing a lovely background to our meal. Memorable, wonderful experience.",,Oct 2018

LVP,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,1,null,null,null,null,"Where to start. After reading several reviews on Nautika i decided to book a table on the patio for our three year anniversary, well in advance. On email I was informed of the timings for the first row (18.30 and 21.30 seating) but that they accepted other timings for the evening but they will have to be only on the second row of the patio. I confirmed 2nd row on the patio would be fine and was very much looking forward to this Michelin star experience at 19.30. For completeness i think it’s also important to note that we live in London and have not only dined at numerous Michelin star restaurants here, but all over the world; Amsterdam, Rome, Cape Town, Italy, Spain... so we’re not newbies here, although even without that experience it wouldn’t be hard to rate this as a total fail on their part. 

It was our first day in Dubrovnik and not realising the traffic coming into the old town by car (despite looking like we were a 5 min drive away) i realised at 19.20 (10 minutes before the reservation) that we were going to be around 10-15minutes late, so i called the restaurant and informed them / confirmed they would hold our table etc. We arrived and the hostess took us to our table, except the table was not on the patio - it was on the side terrace - tucked in the corner, which meant our view was that of tourists looking at the beautiful Adriatic sea! I pointed out i had booked well over a month ago and had specifically requested a patio seating for our anniversary, at this point the manager came out and i explained the situation saying this was not acceptable and not what i had booked, he didn’t apologise, instead he proceeded to tell me it was a ‘first come first serve on the patio’ (blatant lie) and proceeded to say with a smirk on his face something along the lines of “but don’t worry, you’re not going to let this ruin your evening are you? You’re still going to have a wonderful time”. Wow, so you not only give our table away then proceed to tell me i need to get over it. Outrages, it gets worse from there, i asked him to move us once a table became available, at which point he said that he wasnt sure that will be possible as they are fully booked for the evening (!) so firstly, they gave our table away, secondly they didn’t apologise and finally they weren’t going to try fix it at all. I struggle to wonder if we were treated this way because we were a gay couple? I doubt he would have talked in that nonchalant manner to a man. We really should have left at this point but as it was our first night in Dubrovnik, and our annniversary we decided “not to let it ruin the evening”. Unfortunately it just didn’t get better from there, we felt the waiters were totally pompous and fake, nothing felt genuine about this restaurant. To top it off we ordered two starters and the tuna for the main and the food was very average! The tuna was the blandest tuna steak i have ever had. How is this a Michelin star restaurant?! Even the food was sub-par. 

Shame really as on paper it looked like it would be a real winner. We dined the following night (to make up for this failure) at Above5 restaurant - now that is a 5 star place, Naukita management could learn a lot from that team of excellent staff and management. We were in Dubrovnik for a further 6 nights and Naukita was by far the worst dining experience we had, there are so many excellent and better restaurants in Dubrovnik, please don’t waste your money over this overly hyped restaurant.",,Aug 2018

We were seated outside with a spectacular view of the water, landscape and fortress. We had a 6:30pm reservation and totally loved having cocktails while the boats and kayakers moved gracefully through the waters below and the sunset changing the sky palette as we took in the view.

There are cozy white wraps if one is a bit chilly as the sun sets, as well as heat lamps- very comfortable.

Our servers were top notch- informative, polite, and pleasant to be nearby if we needed a refill of our drinks or help with our selections.

The salads and soup courses were creatively presented as well as so
delicious! 

Our entrees followed with the same artistic perfection.a few of us would recommend the beef fillet - grilled to perfection- and so tasty... hit the spot if you choose meat over the variety of fish offered.

We almost didn’t choose dessert- but decided to share 2 for the 5 of us. A taste of chocolate cake and a lemon treat.

Nabbing a table is close to impossible. But somehow, my lucky stars enabled me to snatch one when I decided to walk-in. The restaurant’s debonair and hospitable Manager Marko made sure my dining experience was beyond exquisite. I had 2 starters and skipped the main course because I have a relatively small appetite. Each dish was prepared with aesthetics and gastronomy merging beautifully like a well-orchestrated symphony. Another thing worth mentioning is that they do not have a wine list. What they have is a thick hardbound book containing an extensive selection of local and international wines!

The evening may have honestly been the best, total restaurant experience we've ever had. The location, the meal, the wine, the service... every aspect was impeccable. 
We made reservations weeks in advance to ensure we had front row on the terrace. This provides an unobstructed view of the Old City walls, and the Adriatic. It just made the evening all the more magical. 
From the moment we arrived, the service was personal and exceptional. We were introduced to our head waiter Mario (awesome), along with the sommelier. They managed to always be available, without hovering. 
For starters, we had the Foie Gras. This simply was the best we've ever had. It was perfectly prepared, and the sommelier paired it with a delicious, local, white wine. Honestly, I could have simply had another serving, and been complete for the meal. ""Amazing"" is not hyperbole in this instance. 
For main course we had the Beef Fillet. It was very good. We both prefer ours a little more rare than this came out, but it was nevertheless delicious. Again the sommelier's recommendation was perfect. We had a local red (Dingač, big, full-bodied) which went perfectly with the beef. 
We turned down dessert because we were in a good spot, but did decide to have a Dubrovnik coffee. It's their twist on Irish coffee, using a local liqueur made from carob. It was excellent. A chocolate-like flavor without being too sweet. Truly one of the better coffee drinks we've had. Since we didn't order an actual dessert, they brought us out a small selection of chocolate truffles. Just the perfect finishing touch. 
Typically when we travel, we're ""One & done"" as pertains to dining, but this experience was so extraordinary that we've already made reservations to return to Nautika prior to our departure next week.

ThomvanOs,"Naarden, The Netherlands",The Netherlands,2,1.0,2.0,2.0,null,"We entered restaurant Nautica with a lot of joy, looking forward to what we though was going to be a near Michelin Star dinner. Well I must say it wasn't, not even close. 
This restaurant is full of people who lost grip with reality, thinking they are the finest restaurant (according to their advertisement), but in real life they belong to the middle class. 

I don't like to right negative stuff, but this restaurant is so overpriced against other great restaurants in Croatia, that I like to add a little review. 

So some details: food not coked perfectly, wine pairing with different kind of menu's same wines and both not matching at all. Where the wine is great, with the food it brings both food and wine down. The food is not up to standards. Can go in a lot of details, but I think that's not fair. 

So in short: Superb location! Arrogant service and average food. Price/quality disastrous",,Aug 2018

However I’m not sure if it was worth the hefty price. My husband ordered a seafood dish that albeit was delicious (according to him) - it was not a big enough portion for the price paid and he left hungry. I ordered the truffle tagliatelle which was delicious but was on the starter menu so I’m confused why it was served as a main on the vegetarian menu. The price was the same on both menus - I did ask if it was a main meal portion, to be told yes but it was tiny so im dubious. I would have ordered a starter but goats cheese is not to my liking and that was the only veggie starter. But once again I’m unsure what was supposed to be a starter/main. We contemplated grabbing more food from elsewhere while we were paying the cheque we were THAT hungry. I did not feel our waiter was approachable enough to ask again about portion sizes so we paid and left feeling unsatisfied.

Nautika is clearly a restaurant that takes unbelievable pride in delivering a special experience to its guests; it's a level of service that's incredibly hard to execute from top to bottom. The food and wine list is as good as advertised; they do an amazing job with the scallop/potato/kale small plate and the flavors and richness of their shrimp and polenta dish is outstanding. Fresh fish availability was more diversified than in other high-end restaurants in Dubrovnik and we enjoyed trying a few things we hadn't seen on other menus.

FoxyRoxy,"Hong Kong, China",China,4,null,null,null,null,"I booked this restaurant about a month previous after doing much research.

Let me be upfront about the things I felt that stopped me from giving it 5 stars:
- I made the booking and was told in the email to reconfim. It didn’t matter what number I used none worked to do so. I went to the restaurant a half hour earlier to make sure my reservation was still kept and ‘there was no problem’. So, here is my issue - you take my credit card details and tell me that you will charge me if I don’t show but I can’t get a hold of you and neither can my hotel (Hilton) you have a problem and that is not on the customer side.
- Further - I specifically asked for the terrace (upper) with the view. But as typically seen by Europeans single means ‘cheap’. Really? I was VERY disappointed by this that I was seated on the lower terrace and I was the first there.
- You take bookings as 6pm but I was told to wait in the lobby as you are having your wait staff meeting....wait...should that not be done before your 6pm booking?? Crazy talk...you need to get your act together people.
- It rained - like stormed for a while at the beginning of the dinner. I told the staff. They were too busy rescuing all the other tables rather than the table I was at and had to get myself out of the rain before I was seen to. I would have thought the guest would have been the first to been to?
-Lastly - small but when I mentioned wiith excitement that there was a double rainbow after the rain to the wait staff...I was told all about how a rainbow occurred. Like...really? I teach science and I know how the world works...I was just pointing it out so she might share with other customers about it so that they might like to get a picture...didn’t need the science behind it (which she got wrong btw).

Can I please share about the incredible things that happened:
- it rained (as mentioned) the temperature dropped and I was asked if I would like a lovely white blanket to keep me warm - the waiter ( I wish I could remember his name!) told me how to sit so that he could wrap me the best.
-The food (that fish soup) was incredible!
- Overall service was great.
- Sea bass....the best ever! That vanilla flavor!
- Great waiter with great knowledge of wine
- Wasn’t made to feel strange by being a female eating by myself - they get exta for this

I would come back? Yes! Yes! Yes! Great place and great food but for me not quite 5 star...yet...",,Jul 2018
chiefy134,Essex,Essex,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,null,"This review gets 5/5 based on the service alone. I booked a table on the terrace outside a couple of months in advance for our special Anniversary, and I got exactly what I asked for. The communication from the reservations team was excellent, and the service from the moment we arrived and throughout our meal was exceptional. Food wise, I'd probably give 4.5/5. My starter of shrimp risotto was superb, but my wife's scallop dish was pretty average with the scallop lost amidst the kale and truffle accompaniments. Mains of lamb and beef were very good however, and the chocolate desert one of the best I've had. Champagne was eye wateringly expensive even by London standards but given the occasion I paid up. The evening ended as it had begun with further exceptional service as the restaurant marked our special day with a complimentary cocktail. Thank You.",,Jun 2018
SevenCarat,California,USA,5,null,null,null,null,"Co-worker recommended us to go Nautika and they were so right. Our dining experience at Nautika restaurant was definitely five stars because...

1. View: Nautika seated us by the ocean as we requested...and OMG what a lovely view of Adriatic Sea at the sunset! How else can you indulge yourself for your summer vacay;)

2. Service: our head waiter Mario was so good to us and ensured to send his fellow waiter to our table while he was serving others. Perfect management is what I like.

3. Flexibility for taking orders: I had four courses dinner while my hubby ordered the five course dinner. We don’t drink much so they got us nice local champagne by glass...but it was so great so my hubby ended up ordering white wine by glass a few times more (should have ordered a half bottle).

4. Food: yes as you might have seen all pics of dishes from others all our dishes was beautifully decorated and color coordinated. They use truffle they use wasabi... very delicate combination and tastes were exquisite. Yet what I was most ecstatic about was the soufflé dish with shrimp. I did a little happy dance to it for my first bite:)

5. Price: not cheap I tell you but totally reasonable:)

6. Building: amazing historical building. If you dine outside don’t forget to check out the inside too. They had a pianist playing when I was there and it was just perfect.

Náutika restaurant Dubrovnik

Super attentive specialised service. Excellent, sophisticated food and espectacular views of of the old town. Not much else you can ask for when you go to this excellent restaurant in Dubrovnik Croatia. Expect to pay a high price for the pre fix tasting menu of 5 or 7 courses. Approximately 150
Euros per person and at least another 100 euros for the wine. A 400 euros dinner for two. This is what you pay for when you go to one of Dubrovnik’s two top restaurants. 
Wanting to spend less, don’t go for the tasting menu and pay maybe 100 euros less. If you go, always ask for a 1st row table ocean view table. The sommelier will always decant your wine selection regardless of your selection. Croatian wine is pretty good one and range from 60 to 150 euros a bottle. Dare to try Croatian wines; you will not be disappointed. 
Presentation of the dishes is artistic but not overly worked, which is good in my opinion. 
A great dining and elegant experience if you are willing to spend 200 euros per person. 
Want to spend less, then go to one of the 50 restaurants inside old town. You will
Find dozens of decent restaurants from
Mexican food to local and Italian food, where you will spend 50 euros per person. Want to spend even-less, go to one of the many pizzerías inside old town.",,May 2018

They paired most of the courses with different olive oils, I couldn't really taste the differences with food until the last 'blended' oil, which was rich and delicious. They even provided a truffle oil with the cheese which was so pungent a table nearby thought a bottle had been dropped and I could still taste after the post-dinner grappa.

The venue, the view, the table setting, the decor, the loos (yes - this does matter!!) and most importantly the food and the staff. As another reviewer quite rightly said, you are treated like Royalty. The cocktails not only looked and tasted amazing, but were delivered with so much detail, care and panache. The level of sophistication of the staff was second to none. Attentive, charming and knowledgeable without being intrusive or over the top.

Sarah H,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"This is the restaurant to go to in Dubrovnik if you're looking for a meal that is truly sublime. I booked ahead as I'd read the good reviews and I'm a fussy eater- I want to eat food that is above the ordinary and this restaurant delivered. We had a lovely table on the terrace overlooking the fort and the little bay beneath. The grand piano was playing in the background. Don't be afraid, while the menu is limited what you'll get is suberb. We were offered and accepted the amuse bouche, probably the only less than wonderful dish. A tiny jelly and cream concoction with a grissini stick, which was perhaps too subtle for my palate. I ordered the veal and my companion had the beef. I accompanied my veal with a very pleasant glass of Croatian Zinfandel, I was told by the waiter that Croatia is the original native home of the Zinfandel grape, who knew? The veal medallions were a perfect size, beautifully tender and pink in the middle, accompained by potato galettes, flavoured with a hint of truffle and a pea puree, with a hint of mint. The combination was suberb, savoury, satisfying, interesting and moreish. We finished up with the orange meets prosec dessert, again a brilliant combination of a sweet wine jelly with an orange flavoured delicate layered slice with almond praline, so lovely. The tart wine jelly against the creamy orange, with the soft biscuit layers and the crunchy praline. It was unexpectedly better than I was expecting. The bread rolls were soft,fluffy and fresh, and olive oil; buttery and golden, with a bite. The service was almost choreographed and personal but restrained. From my experience tonight this restaurant is on par with many of the Michelin starred restaurants.",,May 2018

JandJ67,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",USA,5,null,null,null,null,"When we travel, we try to have one really outstanding meal, and we chose Nautica for our trip to Dubrovnik. It exceeded our already high expectations and was a meal to remember.
We prefer formality and the décor, table settings, and service were very much to our liking.
Following a delicate amuse bouche, our starters, Adriatic scallops for me and thick shrimp soup for my wife, were rich and satisfying. Each course was served with a paired olive oil, with the bottle left on the table for topping up and for the warm, fresh bread. 
My sea bass had a perfectly crispy crust that made each mouthful of the fish a nice combination of textures. My wife had ""lobster tail"" and was somewhat disappointed by both the serving size (3 small pieces) and that there was nothing distinctive about the flavor. We had two unusual desserts, and affogato based on coffee liqueur, and a drink called ""Show me the Bird."" My wife had seen a small bird cage brought to a table near us, and we asked what it was. Our waiter said it was their ""signature gin and tonic."" The cage is ceremoniously removed to reveal a large wine glass of flavored gin with rose petals on the base of the cage. Great fun.
Service was formal yet friendly and attentive but not hovering. Dishes were brought to the table on a silver tray by a sous-waiter, with the waiter placing them on the table. Removal was reversed, with the waiter removing the plates and placing them on the tray held by the sous-waiter, who then carried them away. The large staff was uniformly pleasant and helpful.
Wine service included a good explanation of the origin of the wine (Stina, from the island of Hvar).
We dined inside because of the weather, and it would appear that outdoor arrangements are a bit more informal. There are two terraces, a large one next to the sea wall and a smaller, more intimate one, on the upper floor of the restaurant.
Nautika closes for the winter season, so be sure to plan your visit for when they are open.

StewartRobert,"Hong Kong, China",China,2,null,null,null,null,"The best restaurant in Dubrovnik? Maybe in 1972. Dated decor (the upstairs room looks like your gran’s living room - mismatched yellow and blue dining chairs being a particular highlight), dodgy piano player, service straight out of the Monty Python playbook (anything else I can get you?), the okay food over shadowed by the hilarious oversized plates and completely unnecessary olive oil flourishes.

The view and location- It is a short walk from pretty much anywhere in the old city. 
See the photos for an understanding of how close to the city walls you are. At night they are illuminated. We sat outside and it was a bit windy, but super soft blankets were provided on each chair. My suggestion if you are to sit outside would be to bring a light jacket

Cocktails:
While waiting for our table we ordered cocktails while listening to live misc. The pianist took our song request. I had “Show me the bird” G&T and the glass was served in a bird cage with rose pedals covering the bottom stem of the glass. The cocktail was delicious.

Food:
We were blown away by the food both in flavor and presentation. My guest had the 7 course tasting menu. Each course was explained and served with a different olive oil. Each dish was superb. I had the tagliatelle with Istria truffles as a starter and the steak as an entree. Our waiter was professional and genuinely friendly, interesting, and engaging. 

Yes, this is an expensive dinner but we thought it was worth it.

Cageswood,"Slough, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,3.0,5.0,4.0,null,"Nautika proclaims itself as Dubrovnik's finest restaurant and may well be justified in saying so. The location is exceptional and the cuisine distinctive. It's expensive by local standards but the prices are in line with the leading international restaurants among which it can be fairly classed. The on-line menu tells you everything you need to know to avoid bill shock.

The terrace restaurant overlooks the walls of the old town which, despite centuries of real history, are now better known as the setting for King's Landing. The view is stunning although mitigated to some extent by the passing crowds of tourists gathering just outside to take iPhone pictures of the castle and towers. 

Nautika offers a classy but relaxed environment aided by the performance of the pianist whose repertoire helped set the tone.

The cuisine could be described as Dalmatia nouvelle, specialising in local interpretations of contemporary dishes. They claim that they aim to go local in choosing their ingredients and follow this through with distinctive regional touches in the preparation. However, in keeping with the 'nouvelle' approach, the portions are not generous and satisfy the palette more than the appetite.

Service is attentive and helpful, particularly since we had two teenagers with us at dinner for whom this could have been a daunting experience. The waiters were patient with their explanations and helpful in choosing the right local wines to go with our meals. They deliver the style of a Parisian Michelin restaurant but without the arrogance.

Excellent fish and meat dishes were followed by imaginative desserts but the fish soup was watery and lacking flavour. The options for the vegetarian in our party were not inspiring and it took a little effort to have the otherwise excellent waiters bring us a veggie menu.

We made our reservation through the hotel concierge and were surprised to be asked for all our credit card details, including the security number, at time of booking. The concierge explained that Nautika had been arrogant enough to do this ever since hosting the Pope in 2003.

The problem with this exceptional restaurant may be that it's good and it knows it is.",,Sep 2017

Lee C,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,2,1.0,3.0,3.0,null,"I was really looking forward to eating here and when I approached the restaurant I was not disappointed. It's a beautiful building over looking the sea almost perched on the walls of Dubrovnik. There was a piano player in the lobby playing some Lionel Richie covers and it really set the ambience.

The waiter quickly showed us to our table which over looked the sea. The view was lovely but you can get the same view in other places around Drubrovnik. 

I was first a little annoyed when the waiter took me through all the wines on the ""expensive"" list. I like wine and I have money in the bank. However, I refuse to pay more than £50 for a bottle when I cannot tell the difference. He reluctantly showed me the cheaper side of the menu when he saw my disinterest in a £300 bottle of red. He explained...or you can have this ""very basic wine"". I chose one of the ""very basic wines"" which I had enjoyed the night before elsewhere. When the wine arrived it had an awful stench to it. It tasted OK but the smell was definitely wrong. I should have sent it back, but alas I did not as I had already been made to feel like I was a second class citizen for ordering the ""basic wine"" in the first place. 

The starters came and before I could stop the waiter he had splashed olive oil all over my scallops and my partners pasta. I had to literally stop the guy from doing the same on the main.

Down to the food... They seem to think that throwing piles of black truffle on EVERY dish makes it a ""fine dining dish"". It doesn't. 

I was left with a £180 bill for two people. For ""basic wine"" and mediocre food. Given the price this was my worst dining experience in Dubrovnik.",,Sep 2017
Annie M,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"Well, what can I say, other than Thank You for a wonderful experience.

I had a reservation for 18:30, and from the moment I entered the restaurant my every need was taken care of. This was my first solo dining experience (on my first solo holiday) and I was never made to feel out of place. I had a wonderful table on the first row of the terrace with beautiful views and was given a generous 3 hours to finish my meal.

The staff were attentive but not overbearing, and in no way did I feel rushed for time. My very knowledgeable waiter (I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name!) was very helpful in making drink suggestions and explained each dish in perfect detail. As someone who does not eat fish it was refreshing to see the quality and attention put to the non-sea-food dishes; each course was delicious and the perfect size to satiate yet leave room for the next plate.

As another reviewer said, the menu and prices are clear from their website and the menu itself, and I feel the quality of the food and attention to detail in the dishes certainly deserves the pricing.

As it turned out, there was a small error in my bill (which I had not noticed and never would have!). So I was surprised to receive a phone call the next day apologizing for the error and that I would, of course, receive a refund which would be delivered to my hotel (but I chose to pick up from the restaurant directly).

jamesellispt,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"Dubrovnik has plenty of restaurants and plenty of amazing views, so what makes Nautika special enough to take the coveted No1 spot? (At time of writing anyway)

Firstly, yes it is indeed a higher priced establishment. 

These prices are readily available on the website (and upon ordering) so NO this cannot be something used fairly to criticise such a restaurant. I won't bore you with long food descriptions, but you can expect a wonderful fine-dining experience based around fish plates, Croatian traditions and some incredible red meats with a wine selection to die for.

My girlfriend and I experienced a faultless meal which trumps anything else we had during our Croatia trip! I'd actually say that Nautika represents pretty good value for money, considering what we experienced...

- Super slick service provided by well coordinated team. 
- A varied and enticing menu, delivering very well put-together food.
- Unbeatable location for stunning views of the city walls and forts.
- Knowledgeable waiting staff, in our case Mario, who was very warm and informative.
- We made the most of our visit and were shown around the stunning 4 storey building, and made use of the beautifully appointed lounge and loved the pianist! 

Personally I couldn't find any fault with the food, and we found the attention and timing of all staff to be above expectations.
The restaurant manager Tomislav spent a lot of time enthusiastically answering questions and telling us relevant stories.

We felt like Royalty and were lucky enough to have over 3hours here and never felt rushed to leave; to be honest we probably could have stayed for longer sipping our digestifs near reception and listening to the wonderful pianist.

Totally worthy of a 5 star review and the No1 spot!

I did not approach my visit to Nautika with awe or any starry-eyed expectations but, in view of its history, thought that it must be on a par with one-star establishments. The initial amuse bouche was interesting, innovative and tasty, whilst the so-called ""thick"" shrimp soup was almost of consommé consistency. My wife and I decided on the sea bream with French fries and what was served was little more than mundane ""fish and chips"". The fish was of an acceptable standard but not what one would expect from a restaurant with such claims to gastronomic excellence. The wines were superb but, unsurprisingly, were not made by Nautika! Notwithstanding that the bill was less than I have been presented with in many restaurants, it was nonetheless ridiculously high vis a vis the overall quality of the meal.

They bought out an amuse bouche of goats cheese and beetroot which was really lovely, then had our starters of seafood risotto which we said we could've eaten a huge bowl of. Absolutely delicious, the seafood tasted very fresh and portion size was perfect.
I had the fillet steak which was cooked medium/rare as requested, and very pleasant. Nothing to write home about but it was presented beautifully and again was a good portion size. My other half had the rack of lamb which was cooked perfectly and he said was really delicious.
We didn't have room for dessert but they kindly bought out some local liquor and chocolates which was a really nice touch and finished the meal off nicely.
We were absolutely shocked to see our bill come to the equivalent of nearly £200 when we'd only had one alcoholic drink and two courses each. Absolutely ridiculous price - we frequently dine in London's top restaurants and don't pay that much. It was a great meal but should've been nearer £120-140.

From the second we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like Royalty and in no way was this a stuffy restaurant where you were made to feel intimidated. They seriously know their stuff and to that end, give a top class experience to all who dine there.

We lost count of the number of waiters serving us - a truly Michelin style evening.

We had a fabulous table on the front row (book early to secure this!) and we could not have been happier. 3 of us chose from the a la carte and 1 had the 7 course dinner. Every single morsel was first class, as were the beautiful wines and oils the waiters chose to pair for us. We have not stopped talking about this restaurant since the moment we left and no doubt we will do for some time to come. We had smiles on our faces the whole night.

We had a table at 6pm and were told we had to vacate by 9.15pm but in no way did we feel rushed to give up our table at the appointed hour - in fact we offered it back ourselves and had our coffees in the beautiful lounge listening to the pianist playing such lovely tunes.

I would not suggest any particular course to anybody because between the 4 of us we had 16 courses (not including the amuse bouche) and every single one was perfect. 

We have eaten at some top class restaurants around the world and seriously, this is THE BEST. 

Please don't expect it to be a cheap meal but if you want to experience something really special there is a price to pay and we would happily do it again when we come back to Dubrovnik - another trip would not be complete without it!

Lara R,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"We took a chance and tried to find a table for 4 at 8pm on Tuesday night, but as expected they were full, were able to help us at 9:30pm but as we have children, we decided to book and come back the following evening. We were not disappointed.
All the staff from the Maitre D to the servers were all extremely professional, friendly and not at all snooty. This Michelin style restaurant is not to be missed if you go to Dubrovnik, but be sure to book to avoid disappointment. 

The view of the bay from the restaurant is just beautiful, we watched the kayakers come in and had a lovely dinner from 18:30 to 21:15, the sunset was just amazing. But back to the beautiful food. The cocktails were lovely, the attention to detail is just wonderful. 

For starters I had a trio of seafood delicacies, which had lobster and sea urchin meat, with tuna tartar and marinated white fish, this was sublime, it was incredibly delicate and fresh, and I was in heaven. My husband had Adriatic scallops served with truffle flakes with potato and kale cakes, and he said they were the best scallops he ever had. For mains I had lamb cutlets, which were juicy, tender and pink, just the way I like it with purple cabbage, chickpeas and onion marmalade. My husband tuna fillet for mains with capers and rosemary crispy crust, with zucchini spaghetti, which was the most incredible tuna he has ever had, however he would happily have had a few more pieces. That is fine dining for you. Our eldest daughter had fillet steak with roman gnocci and celery chips and mushroom sauce, she said it was sublime. Out 10 year old did not fancy anything on the menu, and was delighted when the waiter offered grilled chicken and chips to her.

Desserts were just as amazing, we had the Orange meets Procek, which had a tasty brittle with orange peel and jelly made with Procek, this was delicious. I had the mini sun dried fig cake, which was a little dry for me, but still very tasty. My daughter had a cheese selection, which we all shared, the truffle cheese and parmesan were gorgeous. The setting sun, the sound of the sea, amazing food and service, and the piano playing inside the restaurant made it all a very memorable evening.

We all left feeling very well looked after, it was a culinary experience to remember and we would love to return when we next visit Dubrovnik. Special thanks to Mario our waiter who was incredibly professional and friendly, From the ex South Africans now living in the UK. We loved your restaurant! Thank you.",,Aug 2017

However our other son's beef was beautifully cooked- the best steak he has ever had 5*. Our tuna was very small (3 bites) and cooked more than the requested medium rare - it was really dry.

My one negative was the cheese plate at the end, couple of local hard cheeses, nuts and dried fruit with bread. All a bit dry and hard, needs more fresh fruit, small crackers and variety of cheese, especially when serving two people the exact same plate a sharing plate would have been better.

The only drawback I see is the price tag of wines and food, it's probably one of the most expensive places in Dubrovnik and not the place to you go for a ordinary evening unless you just have to much money. A good example is a bottle of wine we had in Split 2 weeks ago on one of the top 5 TripAdvisor restaurant where is costed about 350 Kunas cost at Nautika 1200 Kunas, same year of the bottle and all.

We were fortunate enough to book a reservation (the next day – because they were full for the evening on our first request). From the view of the Old City of Dubrovnik (the restaurant is located just outside the wall), to the attentive wait staff (a minimum of three staff members at any given time), and most importantly, to our dining adventure. It was truly an ‘over-the-top’ encounter – something that we will have again, or probably not very frequently. Our culinary experience consisted of a Summer Cuttlefish Salad with mango, beets and avocado; a Tagliatelle pasta with a creamy sauce, black istrian served with Truffle flakes and Scampi also served with Truffles. To accompany our local wine, the staff brought us a local Orange Wine (different – it tasted like whiskey – quite unusual). We realize that Dubrovnik isn’t around the corner, but if you find that you will be going there – definitely get yourself to Nautika it’s a first-class winner all around.

After having spoken to the manager, they were extremely accommodating and moved us to a much better table with a fantastic view over the Adriatic and of the fort. 

Mario (with the glasses) was our waiter for the evening and did a fantastic job of talking us through the menu and also the various Olive oils which they pair to each course. He provided the best service that we have experienced in croatia.

My vegetarian fiance particularly loved the asparagus risotto and the chocolate fantasy desert. 
Every course was delicious and they have a separate vegetarian menu for all you non meat eaters out there. 

To top it off, we were treated to a complimentary liquor at the end of the meal.

Emily W,null,null,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"Nautika was, hands down, our favorite restaurant on our honeymoon. We were lucky enough to grab a reservation at the last minute. 

We sat upstairs on the patio overlooking the Fortress. WHAT A VIEW! 

Our server was Mario and he made the night incredibly special. We started with lobster and sea urchin meat, tuna tartar, marinated white fish. The best thing about this appetizer was the dehydrated olive oil that the fish was served on top of. It was such an interesting taste! 

I had the lobster paste and my husband had the Veal Fillet and Dubrovnik Malvasija Sauce. Both were amazing. My husband's dish had this pea mousse on top of the potatoes gratin, which sounds nuts, but was probably my favorite thing. 

Nautika serves every dish with its own olive oil paring. By the end of the night, we had five different olive oils, which we then did a taste test to see which ones we loved the most. Mario explained what made each olive oil different and even explained how Croatians still make olive oil today. We ended up buying our favorite at a shop in Rovinj. 

We ended the meal with a chocolate cake with raspberry sauce. I don't even really like chocolate or raspberries, and I LOVED this cake. 

But I've saved the best for last! My husband has Serbian parents and was talking to Mario about Slivovitz. Mario then showed up with a cart full of special cordials, one of which was Sliovitz and comped us both a drink!",,Jun 2017

One came in a bird cage and had a name relating to the birds in homage to all the swifts in the city! Another was sprayed with an atomiser, adding to the ambience of the setting and taste of the gin. I had the steak which was the most tender steak I think I have ever had, it cut like butter.(A little salty though, which I mentioned) - However still delicious. The chef sent some desert wine as an apology, though really wasn't necessary. They all couldn't do enough for us. I would definitely recommend this, however it is not a cheap night out.

Kevin,"San Francisco, California",USA,5,null,null,null,null,"My girlfriend and I spent 5 days in Dubrovnik, on the tail end of a trip in Paris. We wanted to have a nice dinner in Dubrovnik that was off the Stradun in the Old City and go to a place that offered some different items than everywhere else in Dubrovnik. We ended up scoring a reservation at Nautika, and we are so happy we did. 

They ran a few minutes behind on the reservation, so when we were seated we were greeted by the restaurant manager and two glasses of champagne. They apologized profusely and we got on with the experience. Our server, Ivan, (highlight of the night) introduced himself and explained that he would be guiding us through the journey that was our meal at Nautika. We aren't Croatian, don't speak Croatian, and don't know anything about the territory, so for us to go to a different restaurant and order what we *thought* looked good would have just kept us in our comfort zone and might have prevented us from having such a great experience. 

We started out with the Fish trio taster. It was simply delicious. Amazing flavors such as fresh Sea Bass, Tuna Tartare, and Lobster were accompanied by dehydrated olive oil which was marvelous. Who knew something so simple could be so good. Ivan explained everything about the dish before we dove in- including where each fish came from and how all the garnishes accompanied the meal. Fantastic. Next, we moved on to the Large Shrimp with Polenta that was infused with a creamy Goat Cheese. OMG. The smooth and rich polenta joined by the tender juicy shrimp was something else. 

For our main course, we shared the Beef Charolais Filet and the Lobster Tail over pasta. The beef was cooked to perfection and was joined by a tasty gnoccho patty and sauce that were fantastic. The lobster tail and pasta had some unbelievable flavors that we only wish we could make at home. Fabulous. 

On to the wine. We had heard coming here that Croatia had some of the oldest grape varietals in the world and found out soon that Croatia is actually home of the Zinfandel grape. We ordered a bottle of the Markus Pepejuh 2013 that went with the meal perfectly. Once again, it was Ivan who asked what we liked and what we desired at steered us in the right direction again. He was flawless, and we hadn't even had dessert yet. Of course, we asked to see the dessert menu. 

We ordered the chocolate mousse with chocolate cake that had a dusting of Salt Flower on top and a raspberry sauce drizzle on the plate. Again, it was incredible. 

I know everyone has different opinions and I'm clearly not a food expert, but this place was probably the best meal all around we have had in 5 years. We do quite a bit of traveling and enjoy dining out often, but Nautika really provided an all around experience that left nothing in question. If you come to Dubrovnik, and you don't mind splurging a bit, Nautika is my one and only recommendation. Make sure you ask for Ivan to be your server and get a reservation several days in advance.",,Jun 2017

Lawyer_in_Motion,"West Simsbury, Connecticut",USA,3,null,null,null,null,"Nautika is one of the more expensive restaurants in town. Some of that, no doubt, goes to offset the rent, the restaurant is on the edge of old town, overlooking the sea. The rest in part covers the team of waiters serving every table and the pianist, who worked really hard to create a romantic ambiance. But as in many other restaurants in Dubrovnik, the service was a little shaky, certainly not commensurate with the menu prices. For example, our glasses sat empty for extended periods of time throughout dinner. The menu itself is limited, which if executed well, can be a strength, but not in our case. Puzzlingly, the tasting menu was nearly identical to the a la carte menu, so we opted for the latter for more latitude. The food was good and at times artfully served, but portions were very small and most of the dishes instantly forgettable. The restaurant makes it a point to garnish each of the courses with a different locally grown olive oil, which did add something to the dining experience, but not enough to make the food stand out. Do yourself a favor, take a few more steps into old town or take a cab to Babin Kuk part of Dubrovnik - you'll find that there are better choices available.

I recommend making reservations as this place has limited seats. If you can, try to time it so your meal begins as the sun goes down to get the best view! Also, request a table right by the edge as you can see in my pictures. It will make the experience that much better!

ATMOSPHERE
The atmosphere of this place is phenomenal. The view is breathtaking, and very romantic. The tables are on a quiet balcony, that overlooks the castle, and water. I would not recommend for children as they are messy and would likely interfere with the mood.

SERVICE
The service was on point and very friendly when we visited. Our server was very welcoming, and gave us lovely descriptions of food and drink as they were brought to our table. This is a fine dining restaurant, so you can expect the service to be amazing.

FOOD
The food is wonderful, and rich but served in very small fine dining portions (as expected). I recommend the scallops for sure as they were so good, we ordered a second portion! The fish dishes were also very good (Croatia is known for seafood!). This is one of those places where dessert is a must. As you can see from my pictures, we ordered the chocolate cake, and the pear dessert which had a liquor pour over vanilla ice cream.

The food, the delicious Croatian wine, the ambiance, the breath taking view and last but by no means least the amazing staff all made the evening perfect. What fabulous way to begin a holiday.

Everything was wonderful, from the stunning views to the impeccable service. Our waiter Mario had some very helpful suggestions to guide us in our food and wine choices. We could tell that the staff were carefully trained and took a lot of pride in the quality of their work. Very friendly, too. And the food was just dazzling; rich in flavor, texture, and color. They even threw in complimentary dessert wine as a nice gesture for our honeymoon. We noticed too that the waiters brought out some lovely ivory blankets for customers who got a little chilly on the terrace as the sun went down, but we weren't cold. We were simply blown away by our experience at Nautika. I hate to think we could have left Croatia without eating here. I will never forget it!",,Jun 2017

James L,"Essex, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,null,"Having never been to Croatia or the Dalmatian coast I wanted to make sure i visited a quality restaurant whilst I was there. I found Nautika via a somewhat dated looking website but saw the patronage and the setting and went ahead and booked. Since then the website had improved dramatically. I was quite concerned when arriving in Dubrovnik the amount of places the restaurant advertised with leaflets etc and its setting is slap bang in the middle of the tourist center. However, when i finally made it there for dinner it was exceptional. A restaurant in the grand old style where service is paramount above anything else. All complimented by a wonderful pianist and setting. Our waiter, Darko, was attentive, informative and exceptionally good at doing his job. A job that far too many restaurants think is taking an order and putting a plate on a table. Places like Nautika make you realise that it is a highly skilled job only a few can carry off with aplomb. The food was perfect accompanied by various Croatian olive oils (a signature theme of the restaurant). There is a picture of Sir Roger Moore outside on the restaurant terrace at table 37 on the website. I found myself in the same position just a few days after his death and feeling very James Bond as the setting simply begs you to. I would recommend this place to anyone and look forward to going back.",,Jun 2017

We were seated outside the restaurant in the courtyard. A table of 9 we were well looked after. Our Waiters - we had 2 were introduced to us on arrival and helped us with wine and drinks selection. We had heard about the speciality Gin cocktail served in a bird cage - wow! A gin, raspberry, ginger and mint combination served on a bed of rose petals was a work of art. We went for local White wine - delicious. A section of warmed very fresh breads were served to us with oils. Scallops starter was popular amongst our group and a great voice. 3 large scallops with white truffle - delicious. Lobster tail on gnocchi also recommended. Blankets were supplied later evening when the air chilled. A complimentary local drink served at the end of the meal must be tried. It was a fine dining experience and a fine dining bill - worth every penny. Would return. If a couple or smaller group asking for a table overlooking the sea would be recommended.",,May 2017

If I could award 4 1/2 stars I would, and the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars in my opinion is the price in comparison to other similar restaurants we've been to in other countries. (Although we definitely didn't mind paying for such a lovely setting). Our waiter was charming and knowledgable and made the experience to be honest. He chose glasses of white wine specially paired with our starters for us, and both were excellent. We had scallops, prawns, lamb and veal- and all was delicious. We had a 6pm sitting and this was well worth doing as the view during sunset is brilliant. Would definitely visit again- thank you!",,Jun 2017

We had the 7 course taster menu which was delicious particularly the shrimp soup. 

They have a large selection of wines most of which are overpriced however the service is excellent and professional.

The overall experience is possibly slightly over priced compared to similar establishments throughout Europe. 

Would recommend for a special occasion.

JustinReid,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"I always say a great dining experience is made up of 3 equal parts - the food, the setting and the service. Get any one of these wrong and the overall experience isn't perhaps what it could be. As such I'm delighted to say that last night's dinner at Nautika was outstanding on all 3 levels. 

We enjoyed the 7 course tasting menu's where the stand out dishes were the shrimp bisque, the tuna and the veal. This all took place in what could best be described as a Hollywood setting - perfectly positioned looking out onto the walls of the city and the sea beyond. It doesn't get any better.

However perhaps the best part of all was the service - from the manager Marco to our waiter Ivan, we were treated like kings, queens and princesses from the start. Just perfect and truly a very special place to dine when in Dubrovnik.

The shrimp soup and steak medallion were my favorite, however, the cuttlefish cake and carpaccio were superb as well. 

Above all else, the staff was the best. We were served by Peter, Mario, Mario (the 2nd), and Darko. They were very accommodating, even moving us to a seat with a better view once space opened up. The view is gorgeous by the way, looking over the dubrovnik bay at the old town wall and fort.

Michael B,New York,USA,4,null,null,null,null,"2 positives and a negative.... they need to improve their portions (I know I'm American), but it was pathetic.

Starter: 

Shrimp with goat cheese and polenta (good and decently sized)

Main:

Tuna: got 3 small 1 inch by 1 inch cubes of tuna. Ridiculous!

Wine: 2 glasses equal 1 normal one anywhere in the world.

The manager did come over with complimentary glass of wine and some cheese. I first refused but he insisted. Good that he did that. 

My check was $110 without tipping yet. This is for one person.

The service was attentive and informative and not overly snobbish as some places of this standard can be. We ordered a nice bottle of Croatian wine which was delicious. 

Before the starters arrived there was a complimentary goats cheese and pea mouse which was a nice surprise. We ordered Shrimp Soup each, I then had Scallops with truffle and my wife had the Cuttlefish and then we both had the lobster for the main. All was superbly cooked and portion size was ok for this type of restaurant. 

There was also bread with every course and different olive oils which was a nice touch. 

We didn't have room for dessert but the kind waiter wouldn't let us leave without something sweet and brought a small selection of their own white and milk chocolates. Devine!

The view is also simply stunning and couldn't have asked for a nicer location. 

Yes it is expensive - about £100 a head +. But for a special occasion and if in budget I would recommend. 

The only niggle was we had a prior engagement to get to and we had to ask for the bill twice and took about 15 mins to arrive. They did apologise after and said it was an oversight.

We booked nearly 2 months out for a table on the terrace right on the edge, and Nautika did us proud. I'm not saying that's how long you need to book in advance, but this was our Dubrovnik wager on the restaurant we felt would best capture what the place means to us and we wanted to get the view.
Probably one of the most romantic and beautiful restaurant tables in the world.
We then were presented with Mario; who was to look after us both for the night, and he did not disappoint. A true professional and one of our best waiters ever.
The food was excellent and one of the few places, not only matching wines, but also Olive oils to every course.
The Nautika bet came at a higher price than our wagers in Venice and Rome, but our choice wasn't about price, it was betting on an experience and Nautika delivered.

The food is outstanding: our starters of beef carpaccio, fish soup and scallops, mains of seabass and dentex, and desserts all impressed. Our waiter was charmingly hospitable and knowledgeable, describing the dishes, deftly de-boning and serving up a whole dentex, advising on wines and discussing the merits of the different olive oils on offer with skill and panache.

Tom H,"San Diego, California",USA,5,null,null,null,null,"I'm back in Dubrovnik and dined at one of the city's best restaurants, Nautika, located just outside the Ploce Gate entrance to the beautiful walled city. 
There's a reason Nautika continues to garner rave reviews. It's simply outstanding! You can dine inside, on the front patio, or the side terrace which offers diners spectacular views of the Adriatic. 
The Nautika's ambiance is wonderful with its redecorated interior and the live piano music of maestro Nevio Koncic, one of the city's most talented musicians. He knows every classic you can think of. And, he sings, too! 
Marko Bajagic, the Food & Beverage Manager, takes personal delight in greeting each table to ensure your complete satisfaction. 
My waiter, Ivan, knows the menu forwards and backwards. I trusted his recommendations on various selections and was not disappointed. 
Although Nautika is popular for its 5 and 7 course dinners, I opted for something less filling, but equally delightful. 
Their shrimp soup is superb. My entree was the sea bass with vegetables and it was perfectly prepared. Ivan recommended a glass of the Casa Grassvina Mitrovac, a smooth white wine from Croatia's northern region. It was light and refreshing and went well with the sea bass. 
I splurged on dessert and ordered Ivan's favorite, their chocolate fig cake. It was a great finish to one of the best meals I've had in Europe. 
Nautika is moderately priced. My dinner costs 560KN (US$85) which was reasonable given the excellent quality of food, wine, service and location. Gratuities are extra at 10-15% usually. 
When you visit Dubrovnik, plan one very special dinner at Nautika. 
By the way, Nautika is one of four restaurants owed and operated by the same group. The others are Dubravka 1836, and Panorama located atop the cable car station on Srd Hill with its spectacular views of the city and coastline. Their fourth restaurant is Gradska kavana Arsenal located inside the old walled city. Enjoy!",,Apr 2017

hhammerman,"St. Louis, Missouri",USA,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,null,"We ate at Nautika Restaurant our first night in Dubrovnik. Nautika lies on the edge of the sea, alongside the western entrance to Dubrovnik's Old City. The restaurant is housed in the former Dubrovnik School of Maritime Studies, where it welcomed seafarers as far back as 1881.

Nautika was recognized as sixth most romantic restaurant in the world by Condé Nast Traveller magazine. Its cliffside terrace offers breathtaking views of the Adriatic and the fortresses of Lovrijenac and Bokar.

Nautika specializes in seafood dishes that are specific to the Dalmatian coast. There were lots of enticing dishes to choose from on the menu. We started with the scallops and the trio of seafood delicacies.

Both dishes were beautifully presented. The scallops were served with potato and kale cakes; a nice combination of flavors. Of the trio of fresh Dalmatian delicacies – tuna tartare, lobster and sea urchin meat, and prawns – the prawns were the most interesting. They were perfectly poached and served on a bed of fresh cucumber and cheese. The cucumber added crunch and the cheese offered a creamy, sharp taste to the prawns, which had been marinated in olive oil, white wine and lemon.

For our main courses, we shared the sea bass and the lobster tail pasta. The sweet tender lobster atop perfectly cooked homemade pasta was a nice dish. But the sea bass was outstanding. The sweet acidic preparation perfectly complimented the tender fish and its crispy skin.

Our first dinner in Croatia ended with a sweet finish – a yummy ""chocolate square"" dessert!",,Oct 2016

It is quite romantic except there are a lot of tables on the terrace, so it isn't private at all unless no one else is there.

The food is among the best in the city. It specializes in fish and seafood (hence the name), but meat dishes are just as good, so consider this if your party has a mix of fish and meat lovers.

Had the scallops with Truffles from the hot appetizer menu and it was delicious ! My friend had the Shrimp Risotto, also very good. 
For entrees we had the lobster with pasta and filet mignon. Both delicious. The chef is brilliant!
I read that the food was average and the portions small. Totally disagree!
For dessert we had a bartender special- wow!!! Vanilla ice cream with sliced baby pears, accompanied by a teapot full of zacaba rum and Tia Maria! A bit strong for a non drinker like me but luscious. We finished our night with the very talked about, Gin and Tonic. 
Sooo Special. I won't spoil the surprise but definitely have one. 
The atmosphere , service and friendliness was nothing short of impeccable. Mr Marco , the

My husband and I work in travel for a living, so we've been so many places and so many countries. (And have eaten in SO many restaurants!) 

Nautika was right up there with the best. 
The ambiance, service, and food are unbeatable. The view alone is simply spectacular.
Every dish was meticulously created to be something truly special. 
It's rather pricey, but we felt it was well worth every penny. 

(We had two glasses of wine, mineral water, shrimp soup, two warm appetizers (scallops and shrimp risotto), two entrees (veal and lobster), and a shared dessert (yummy orange cake specialty). Our total bill was 1600 kuna, which is about $230 US, not including tip.)

Like most restaurants in this caliber, the portions could be a bit larger. (My husband likes to eat.) But this by no means takes away from the overall experience. (If you arrive hungry, order an appetizer along with your entree.) Plus, you get bread included, with a variety of award-winning olive oils.)

We had researched on Tripadvisor for the places to eat in Dubrovnik and Nautika Restaurant came out tops in the 'fine dining' category. We also had a long list of restaurants that we we wanted to try out. Funny enough and by chance, our tour bus stopped us right in front of Nautika Restaurant where we started our short walking tour of the Bokar Fortress in the afternoon. What luck! We managed to reserve a table for two for dinner on the same day. We requested for a table at the patio with a sea view and a view of Lovrjenac Fort (St. Lawrence Fort). Very friendly service and courteous restaurant staff from the start (when we first made the table reservation).

More than enough for us. There is a 7-course meal (for an extra USD10 or thereabouts) if you're hungry or keen to try more, and don't want to bother too much with the a la carte items. Everything turned out perfectly prepared and the attending waiter was very friendly and informative about the food and the different types of accompanying olive oils that were presented to us. The restaurant manager was equally courteous and was very receptive. When I asked about our 'not-so-inconvenient' wait for our mains, he apologised, gave us complimentary 'top-ups' on the pouring house white, and explained that they did not want to 'rush' us on our romantic dinner. Then our mains came within 2 minutes. Now that's a good recovery! Dinner took close to 2-3 hours.

A number of lanterns with candles are perched along the wall and the sound of the water, especially when boats go by, and the lights on the nearby forts add to the ambiance.

The setting was spectacular, the service was first rate, and the food was incredible. While this is an expensive restaurant, we found it worth the money. They provide blankets for the patrons if you wish them, although we found we did not need them. They also have heaters on the patio for each table if you prefer to have them on (we didn't but our nearest neighbours did and we unfortunately found the bright red glow from theirs took away from our ambience. Eventually we asked our servers to redirect the light away from us which helped).

Our meal started with breads and 5 types of olive oil to try. We also got a seafood amuse bouche which was also excellent. I ordered the sea bass, which was amazing. We also ordered a bottle of Grgich Posip, which was so good we had to find a wine store to get some more to bring home to Canada with us.

Richard I,"Jersey, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"Rated as one of the best restaurants in Dubrovnik, we were looking forward to our visit and we were not disappointed. You need to book in advance, especially if you want a table on the terrace overlooking the cove. The food is well presented and tasty with a strong fish bias, service is excellent and our waiter was extremely helpful, explaining the menu and the wine list, which contained a large selection of local wines. Croatian wine is of a very good quality, production is on a small scale, so not much is exported, as with all things in life, quality does not come cheap, expect to pay £25+ in restaurants. If you are on a budget, Nautika may be the treat of your holiday, as prices reflect the high standards, however compared to London or Paris they are quite reasonable.
At the end of our meal, we were treated to a complimentary local liquor with our coffee. It may be pricey but it was worth it, just treat yourself.",,Sep 2016

We came with our good friends and travel buddies totalling 8 people. We arrived an hour early than our reservation and wanted to take more pictures of the Old City.

My husband and I had the best time there. Our waiter was so passionate about the restaurant and really wanted to know our thoughts on the food, olive oil and wine. 

The balcony views are perfect for an evening dinner. They offer heat lamps and blankets for comfort. The restaurant wants to take every opportunity to improve and really wants customer feedback. We were asked about which of the flight of 5 regional olive oils were our favorite (the truffle infused one had an unfair advantage here) and were also polled for our favorite dish of the night. We loved the veal dish. 

If you want a romantic dinner with a view, I'd recommend this place. After all, this place was recommended by a friend and I'd continue to do the same. If you are asked to pick a ""grappa,"" the Walnut was perfect! :)",,Sep 2016

Jim A,"Birmingham, Alabama",USA,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"We had a fantastic evening at Nautika Restaurant! Not only was the food outstanding, but the service was off-the-charts! Everyone we interacted with was gracious, welcoming and just lovely! And there is no way to adequately describe the stunning location - with crashing waves below you, the walls of the Old City lit to your left, and the hulking Lovrijenac Fortress shining on your right. 

From the starting cocktail and amuse-bouche to dessert and glass of port, every sip and bite was delectable. The wine list is extensive and contains many well-curated Croatian wines. Thankfully, all of the 8 head waiters and the maître d' are well-trained somelliers and ours selected the perfect one for us. The menu changes and there is something for every taste. They will also gladly customize any dish. (I don't like fish and was worried when I looked at the menu outside the restaurant. But I was exceedingly pleased with my waiter's suggestions.) And each course was served with a different custom Croatian olive oil which was also explained by the waiter. One won the international Grand Prize last year. After dinner, we were offered a tour of the restaurant and wine cellar. Although we sat on the upper terrace, the restaurant is also very beautiful and offers private dining rooms as well. 

Other than ""trust your waiter"", my only other recommendation is a big one: Make reservations in advance so that you can request a table on the front row of the terrace.

When I approached the hostesses they were both gracious and accommodating and showed me to a table, explaining that they were fully booked. If you wish to be seated closer to the water and the walls, make a reservation! Once seated, the wait staff was somewhat surly and dismissive--I was in jeans and an overworked T-shirt. I was presented with the menu and wine list. The menu is short, featuring a limited choice but highlighting two separate tasting menus. I asked for the apertif menu and ordered one. The attitude of the wait staff changed. For starters I had the Carpaccio Charlais, garnished with caviar and thin slices of Parmesian cheese. The combination was delightful, but the beef was a bit chewy. I followed that with the tuna fillet, which was accompanied by an ingenious spaghetti cum zucchini thinly julienned and intricately intertwined served chilled. I ended the meal with the fantasy fruit chocolate, which consisted of a chocolate shell filled with custard and a medley of fresh fruit. The wine list is extensive in the extreme but dining alone I ordered my wine by the glass. I must admit the plating of the dishes was superb and visually attractive, and each course was brought to the table on a silver tray by a junior and then served by a senior.

Facility: multi story building with multiple levels for dinner but outside is where everyone eats in the summer. Inside is well air conditioned. The facility was completely remodeled in 2015 and is beautiful and classic. White tablecloth service. 

Service: 100% professional. English speaking. 

Food: I have to recommend the appetizer tagliatelle with the truffle..........WOW.....I could eat it for every meal. My wife and I shared it but I should have made her get her own. We both agreed. 
Main courses: this is a fish eating area being on the coast but we were done with fish after 2 weeks so we went with meat. She had the steak with a gnocchi that was more like polenta but still very good. I had the veal tenderloin and both were excellent. Make sure your are specific on the temp you want the meat. My family is Croatian and they have a tendency for medium whereas we prefer rare to medium rare. 

Desert: fruit & chocolate and also a chocolate ""square"" which were excellent. The square is rich do be forewarned. 

Wine list: best I had seen. They also have Opus One and Petrus if you have that budget level. I went to the wine cave and storage is properly done and monitored. Side note: the waiter recommended a Plavi Mali which I have had before but it was fruit forward and too sweet so I changed and went with a cab/cab-franc/Merlot blend that was excellent. Our desert wines were great. I had an ice wine they make here and only 600 cases and it got the top award in Europe. Fantastic.

rhyshedges,"Oxford, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"I wish Tripadvisor had more grades above three average, maybe four good, five excellent, six - superb and seven - mind blowing. If they did this would be a seven. Why?

Well the location gets it off to a good start. Just outside the town walls with stunning views of the walls and the sea. Throughout the meal, less fortunate visitors crowded outside the restaurant to take photos. Then there were the swallows, wheeling and crying as they swept round the tower.

But of course the food is important and here the restaurant performed well. Everything was tasty and of a high standard, not only the main courses but also the bread and olive oils.

For us, wine is important and there was a comprehensive wine list.

But for any restaurant it lives or dies by its staff and we were fortunate to be served by Marco. He pushed this firmly into the seven star wow category. He is a highly qualified sommelier and relished the opportunity to talk to people interested in wine. Indeed he even took us round his cellar. If you eat here and have any interest in wine, however slight, ask for Marco's advice.

We turned up at 6 pm at the end of August when the restaurant opened and got the only available table so I would advise booking in advance. They have some tables round the corner with even better views so if you want these book well in advance.

We both had the lobster tail which was fresh and sweet and served on a bed of pasta and broad beans. For dessert I had a chocolate and fruit tray and he had the chocolate square. Neither were too sweet or filling. We enjoyed traditional Croatian wines on recommendation by our waiter, as well as tasting some local olive oil which was lightly poured on our meal.

More surprising was the bill. $750 American dollars later we were able to feed six people including one bottle of local wine and three cocktails in addition to our meals.

Upon arriving we were shown to our table and looked after superbly by our waiter. Each waiter had a helper to which we thought was cute!

The view is really something. After spending a week looking at the city walls it's really a treat to see the sights. 

We ordered mains and a wine by the glass and after reading some of the reviews on here never once felt like we weren't been looked after as well as others spending more

We had steak and fish for mains and both were beautifully cooked and presented. We had time out before desert and never felt rushed which was nice

I ordered desert and coffee and the wife a tea. The waiter brought out some homemade chocolate which was nice. 

The bill wasn't cheap, easily the most expensive meal of the holiday and we've eaten in almost all the top 10 on here. 

The food was on par with other fine dining, the service too. The usp is the view and I don't think the premium on price is proportionate to it. Despite this I'm happy we had the experience and would recommend if in Dubrovnik and not on a budget",,Jul 2016
TheNobleman,"Ousden, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"Our third visit to Croatia and second visit to this amazing restaurant. The first time a couple of years ago was astonishing and this visit with the children (both 17 years) was no less and even better. The food and wine is just sublime but what makes this so special is the perfect and professional service from all the staff.
Our booking was made three weeks before we travelled to Croatia. On the day, we journeyed into Dubrovnik at 11am from Lopud Island where we stay and had time to visit some shops and sites before dinner at 6:00pm. The weather being hot we didn't want to walk around in our evening clothes and the staff were very kind enough to allow us to leave a change of clothes for when we returned to eat.
Every course was just delicious and the pre-starter was unbelievably good. The children can be choosey at times with food and that can make fine dining a little tricky, but like us, they both resoundingly approved of everything, the food, the service, the setting, the ambiance and the whole experience.
The attention to detail is impressive, from the knowledge and choice of local wine by the sommelier, the presentation of different olive oils for each course and the Maître D' remembering my first review on TripAdvisor.
At dessert my partner commented on her choice and that although it was delicious, she might have made a different choice having seen what everyone else had. With this in mind but not because of it, but because we were returning customers and the fact we show our appreciation, we were rewarded with a lovely surprise.
So we will return as this is on our list of favourite restaurants in the world.

NavyWife11,"Naples, Italy",Italy,4,null,null,null,null,"My husband and I had dinner here on our 5th wedding anniversary. We made reservations in advance through the restaurant website, but never received a final confirmation from Anita (the Sales Manager). When we arrived in Dubrovnik, we had to have our hotel call to ensure that we had reservations. Even though we offered to dine at any time, Anita informed us that the only table left for that night was in the ""third row from the sea"" on the ""Brsalje terrace."" When we arrived, we saw the HORRIBLE table that we reserved for us. It wasn't even close to the sea. I wouldn't even call the ""Brsalje terrace"" a terrace. It was a street level table in front of the restaurant. You could hardly see the ocean and the noise and chaos from all around us would have undoubtedly ruined our experience. Luckily, the seating hostess, Maria, sensed my extreme disappointment and offered to show us another table on one of the small upper terraces. It was beautiful. Though we weren't near the wall facing the sea, we had a lovely view and there were only 4 tables on the terrace. It was very private and very serene - perfect for celebrating an anniversary.

While the food that we ordered was delicious, we were extremely underwhelmed by the service of our waiter. He seemed to cater to every table except for ours, and we are convinced it is because the other tables were ordering multiple bottles of expensive wine. Unfortunately for the restaurant, we did not partake in the extensive wine list that evening because I am 8 months pregnant. My husband enjoyed a glass of wine and we enjoyed multiple courses, but it was not enough to warrant the waiter's attention. I had to continuously ask for water (every single time that I ran out) and we had to wait a long time in between service even when I tried to get his attention. He was just entirely too preoccupied with the other tables. At the end, the waiter brought out a nice table with homemade Croatian liqueurs. He spent quite a bit of time with each table, allowing them to taste multiple and have their fix. He COMPLETELY skipped over our table and asked if we wanted some as an afterthought. It was so disappointing. Additionally, the restaurant did NOTHING to celebrate our anniversary, even though I told Anita, Maria, and the waiter. A simple candle in the dessert that we paid for would have been nice. When spending this much on dinner for two (approximately 190 euro), we just expect better service and to be treated special. While the food was good, we will definitely not be going back. There are plenty of other great restaurants in Dubrovnik.",,Jul 2016

However we were told to just turn up on the day as cancellations were likely. However as we passed the restaurant I thought that I would ask to be advised if a cancellation did appear and left my phone number. Within 15 minutes I received a call to say we were booked in for the following night as requested.
I was somewhat surprised to find the internal tables were empty whilst the terraces were full as we were taken up to the higher terrace.
Opting for the 7 course degustation menu and a good bottle of Serbian white wine we began the epic journey. It was nearly midnight when the final cheese course arrived and by then I was ready to leave.

Having ordered an excellent bottle of Chablis, we started with a lovely amuse bouche involving some local cheese. Spoilt for choice I reverted to type and ordered two starters. The first was a stunning trio of tuna, prawns and sea urchin which was both beautiful and tasted amazing. JR ordered the beef fillet for his main and I moved on to the shrimp risotto. Both these dishes were faultless. Indeed, at this point I was considering divorce and running away with the chef. Service was attentive but not intrusive. Staff were knowledgeable and obviously have great pride in the restaurant and the food it serves. We could not manage dessert but were offered a liqueur to finish our meal which was delicious.

The location is superb. Book a table in the terrace looking out to sea. We did, sitting right at the edge with views out to sea and to the old city walls. 

Our waiter, Darko, was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We gave him the challenge of finding a wine to match both fish and beef and his recommendation was excellent. The service throughout from Darko as well as the rest of the team, was probably the best we've ever experienced, and we eat out a lot across the world. Unfortunately we didn't catch his name but the front of house Manager was excellent and made my birthday a very special event. 

The food was amazing, and they even arranged a surprise birthday cake for me. We didn't have the tasting menu but ate off the a la carte menu and were very happy with every course.

Fawaz Shalan,"Amman, Jordan",Jordan,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,null,"We had a perfect table, overlooking the castle and the old walls of the city. Absolutely and completely delightful.

We had the degustation menu and the food was great. Of the five courses I truly enjoyed four as I didn't think much of the fish soup. Otherwise everything else was really delicious. Of note, the tuna tartar and the shrimps on polenta.

We were given a free after dinner digestive and I went for the cherry liquor which was full of flavor.

So why 4 out of 5? 

It certainly wasn't the cost, At about 100 Euros per person I found it quite reasonable for the quality.

It was a couple of little things. First the waiters were pushing the alcohol. I don't mind being asked if I care for a glass of champagne to start but I do mind being asked twice by the same waiter. The second are the ""airs"" that the Maitre'De tries to put on, as if to remind us that we are in classy establishment. 

Anyone coming here and willing to pay the price obviously knows their food, so please just calm down and do what you do best.

A pianist was playing just inside the entrance, a lovely touch as his music was streamed throughout the venue. 

A simple menu, I think perhaps 4 options to each section, but all varying greatly to one another. 

We were given a choice of tables and took one in a corner on an upstairs terrace overlooking the Fort. 

Each course came with knowledge of locally produced award winning olive oils and were used to dress each course at the table. 

To start we were served aperitifs, a green tea mousse with a cuttlefish ink 'crisp'. The flavours were so so good. 

To follow we had scallops and a prawn and asparagus risotto. 100% for presentation. My O/H said his scallops were a little slimy, I think perhaps a tad undercooked for his taste. My risotto was a generous portion. Enough for a main course. Good flavours, plenty of prawns throughout. 

For main course we had Beef Filet and Tuna. I could not believe the size of the beef, lol! A huge portion, tender and well seasoned. My tuna was a brave choice, it had a caper and Rosemary crust, not usually so fond of capers but the flavours were well matched and I'm definitely a 'caper convert'. 

We declined dessert, but we were served some choices of local liquors.

The location of the restaurant by the old town, facing the sea and magnificent fortresses, is quite spectacular. We had a table outside, and the individual radiator placed behind and above us kept us warm enough through the evening.

Our waiter was experienced, fun and a great MC for the evening. He chose the perfect regional wines for our dishes, and shared his enthusiasm about the special Croatian olive oils that were tied in the dishes and the tasting.

The thick shrimp soup (without cream) was spot-on. The taste of shrimps and shellfish was astounding in the reduced and thickened broth, with large whole shrimps and ""coins"" of fresh cheese in it.

The veal was among the best of the best we've had, done to a perfect rosé medium as we had asked, and the potato cakes laced with truffle and spinach mousse added to the round, succulent impression.

A cheese and lemon parfait and a cake of dark chocolate, almonds, sun dried figs with orange-ginger sauce were our happy desert choices.

It was a little chilly, so we were wrapped up in soft white blankets and an electric heater was provided. Our waiter Mario catered to our every need, explaining wine and food with expert knowledge. Each course came with a recommended olive oil which added depth and flavour, along with a little bit of theatre. We were not constantly bothered, but our wine and water glasses never ran empty. The food was exquisite, and between us we never left a crumb on a plate. Beautifully cooked lobster tail, veal and lamb, professionally presented with wonderful accompaniments.
On finishing, we enquired about one of the dessert wines, and immediately a sample was brought for us to taste. The digestif provided at the end of the meal was both unexpected and delicious.
As we left, we were invited into the wine cellar, and Mario, along with the maître' d talked us through some of the most popular wines from the different regions of Croatia - a real education.
Thank you for making our final evening in Dubrovnik such a special one - the staff really went above and beyond to ensure an experience we won't forget.

As we had not visited before we had a chance to see the various rooms and terraces that guests might experience - or the next time we come:) 
We sat at a table with a lovely view of the old city walls. The service was super from start to finish - so nice to see many of the staff we know from Panorama and Gradska Kavana restaurants. 
The food was excellent. We had the Beef Charolais and the Teleci with a great sald to start. Only the desert had a name that didn't fit the course served - easily fixed as it was only their first night of the season.",,Mar 2016
maddy_sc,berkeley,berkeley,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,null,"We came here on the recommendation of one of my clients and immediately noticed that 1) we were seriously under-dressed for the place and 2) it was a bit pricier than any other meal we'd had in Croatia. The view could not be better, but we were worried we'd end up paying for the view and the food would be mediocre. However, we had the impression that Dubrovnik tended to be more expensive than the other cities we'd been to, so we decided to give it a shot. We are definitely glad we did! 

The waiter was above average even for a region with excellent customer service. He made us feel really comfortable, even though we were dressed like shlubs. When he found out we were chefs, he engaged us about our experience of Croatian food and seemed genuinely flattered when we praised his restaurant. The customer service really set this place apart, but of course that wouldn't be worth visiting if the food was not also really good. 

This was the first place we tried the ubiquitous Croatian fish soup. It's a simple soup - fish stock, rice, a little bit of flaked white fish for texture - but it really blew me away with it's flavor. We've been in Croatia for 3 months now, and I've tried many versions of the fish soup, but the one here is still my favorite. Then the entrees arrived. My fiance's was good, but not all that memorable. Mine on the other hand, was amazing. It was (surprisingly) one of the most affordable options on the menu. The sesame encrusted tuna steak was perfectly seared, served rare, with a delightful sauce, and was HUGE. It was the biggest serving of Tuna I'd ever seen. Best value you could possibly hope for. Dessert was a strawberry balsamic tart, which was incredibly flavorful and balanced. 

Overall, I'd say if you're willing to spend the money, Nautika is an excellent fine-dining establishment, with solid food, spectacular views, and a excellent service.",,Sep 2015

Abbey T,"Leeds, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,null,"My husband and I visited Nautika whilst on honeymoon in Dubrovnik. We selected the 7 course tasting menu, which was around £80 per person, so it is a more expensive venue but is definitely fine dining. The setting was just beautiful and I was provided with a fleece blanket for when the evening became chillier, which was a great touch. They also had outside heaters on so it was very enjoyable being outside and experiencing the view to go with the food. The 7 courses were extremely tasty, however (and this is only personal preference) there were quite a lot of fish courses with not many meat courses, but this did not detract from my enjoyment of the food. My only criticism, and this may sound ridiculous, is that the portion sizes for each course were very large. This meant that by course 3 I was stuffed and felt quite uncomfortably full when getting through the rest of the courses. I know a lot of people would enjoy this, but to say it was a tasting menu I thought the sizes could have been slightly smaller, as you get bread also. That would be my only downside as I would have loved to have enjoyed each of the courses equally. The wine was superb, which was recommended to us, and the waiting staff could not have been more efficient. Definitely a place to experience whilst in Dubrovnik.",,Oct 2015

We booked a table on the terrace (a must) and arrived as the Starlings were shooting and diving through the sky, circling the iconic edges of the city walls. Our waiter, I believe was the head waiter and he worked with his team smoothly and efficiently. 

We were treated with an amuse-bouche of young goats cheese, tomato and an accompanying olive oil. Each course was given its own matching olive oil.

We enjoyed Sancerre with our starters (Scallops, Truffle tagliatelle) and then, by suggestion of our waiter, I opted for a Croatian Orange wine to compliment a succulent and flavoursome fillet steak. My wife had the Sea Bream which was delicate, light and delicious.

My husband loved his meal and in hindsight I probably should have ordered what he had - his veal was stunning. I however had lamb for my main which was a bit average. The truffle pasta I had was over the top, completely covered in black truffle - yes I wanted truffle pasta but couldnt see the pasta for the amount of truffle (a mountain of giant shavings)! Black Truffle is such a strong flavour I would expect a chef at this sort of restaurant to use it sparingly rather than overwhelming a dish in this fashion. Same situation with my dessert too, it was chocolate and almond, yet so many almonds in there you couldnt taste the chocolate.Think the chefs struggle somewhat with the balance of flavours which is a shame when working with such wonderful ingredients.

I actually had a similar meal a few days later in Split (at a much cheaper restaurant) with lamb followed by a chocolate and almond dessert, and I had a far better meal with bigger portions for much less! 

We had no input from the sommelier, I am always keen to try local wines when abroad but when I asked what red would go well with my dinner I just got given a glass of house red from the waiter, no attempt to get the sommelier to recommend me anything - probably because we were not ordering a bottle! We got a bit pushed into ordering champagne to start as well which I didnt like; as soon as we sat down they asked would we like an aperitif (Champagne) which turned out to be Moet at £16.50 per glass! Other restaurants we went to also asked if we'd like an aperitif but instead they'd suggest a Croatian sparkling at half the price - I dont like having the most expensive item on the menu forced at you on arrival! 

As I said my husband loved his food here so I'm not in any way saying the food is bad, just the items I ordered unfortunately had poorly balanced ingredients and flavours and had I chosen differently the review could be a very different story! For the money you pay (we spent around £160) I expected more, service didnt stand out, sommelier was non-existent for us and my food wasnt up to scratch.",,Aug 2015

Nautika ticked all the boxes and we would highly recommend this place which we will visit again in future.

The dinner was a surprise evening for my then fiancée-to-be - we were greeted with great professionalism yet with a special/discreet touch arranged throughout the evening.
 
Prior to booking, I had read a small number of negative comments on trip advisor, regarding the service, food or price - as far as we are concerned these were all unfounded. Our dinner experience was fantastic on all aspects, from start to finish. We enjoy gastronomic cuisine and regukarly try very reputable restaurants - we would not normally go on to write reviews but this deserved an exception. 

Nautika is of similar standard to most Michelin-star restaurants we have been to. Pricing wise, it is of course more expensive compared to other restaurants in Dubrovnik Old Town but overall this remains reasonable for the quality you get. We did not go ""À la carte"" - as it was our first visit, we went for the 5-course set menus. Overall we were looking at £200-220 for dinner for two with a glass of champagne and a nicebottle of local Croatian/Bosnian wine (you want to try those local wines - they are a true delicacy compared to the classic and typically expensive French wines).

A special thanks to Nikol and Zlatko, for the lovely service and attendance that evening - and to the Chef, for the amazing food (the tuna tartare in particular was out of this world).",,Aug 2015

TravelAshler,"Carlsbad, California",USA,4,null,null,null,null,"If price is no object and you simply want the finest food, fresh from the sea, somewhat imaginative offerings, although not quite on par with top Michelin restaurants in Europe and North America, fine local wine and exceptional service, Nautika is for you. 

This is a tough reservation to get in season. The patio out front is highly sought after (especially the first row with views of the sea). 

 The ambience is beautiful, situated just outside the Walls of the Old City near the main gate. Dinner begins with an amuse bouche. It took reminding to receive the wine we ordered after our appetizers arrived. Opening and decanting the bottle was a pretentious production complete with candle light pour. 

The cuddle fish salad appetizer was tasty and beautifully presented. The truffled scallops were well prepared but the scallops were tiny. This would have been far superior with large, plump scallops. Truffles were not spared. 

The main courses of lobster pasta with a lovely bean ragout was really great. Succulent morsels of lobster in an imaginative sauce was a big hit. The sea bass was superb on a bed of vegetables. Rather small portion but expertly prepared with a crispy exterior and tender center. This chef is excellent with sea food. 

Overall a fine experience but really nothing to rave about. 

The sea food on the Adriatic coast is first rate. There are many fine restaurants with fresh offerings daily and chefs quite adept at preparing sea food at a fraction of the cost. 

The wine list has a decent selection of outstanding local wines but at astounding mark ups.

igor2806,"Zagreb, Croatia",Croatia,5,null,null,null,null,"Nautika is probably the most known restaurant in Dubrovnik, perhaps even Croatia. It has a reputation of a pricy place with outstanding view on the Lovrijenac fortress and old city walls. Recently the restaurant has changed the owner. With this in mind, we went for a business dinner and had a set, five course menu agreed in advance.

Pricing is difficult to discuss; even in cheap restaurant one can leave feeling ripped off and even in premium venues one can leave feeling light(er) yet very satisfied. Anyways, prices are clearly visible on the menu in front of the entrance, so the main question is – are they justified by the quality of experience.

Nautika has a very professional service that fully justifies its reputation. It reads individual needs, is available just as needed, but subtly present otherwise. My only objection is occasional lack of more elaborate story to carry the dish, selected olive oil or wine selection. Staff can be more spontaneous and laid back and still not compromise professional posture and attitude.

Some dishes were more complex (techniques and flavors), some a bit too simple for the scale of the venue. However, what sets Nautika apart is the quality of ingredients. Adriatic shrimp salad was very rustic in appearance, seasoned mildly and the dish had a bit of a tavern and not fine dining character; nevertheless, the sweetness of the shrimp, its clean sea aroma, firm on bite yet succulent texture were outstanding. Lobster bisque was perhaps a bit heavier in texture than expected, but the depth of flavor and freshness of meat were definitely there. Scallops were perfect, perhaps the best I ever had, and one has to wonder if a more innovative side would improve the dish or just distract raw, genuine, direct experience (offered mash is too basic, if not dull). For the main, sea bass was fresh as fresh can be, but very basic and unimaginative. Finally, the cake was very homemade like, very tasty, but nutritious, heavy. Wine list fits any combination one can imagine. 

Leaving Nautika, we felt relaxed, satisfied and full (perhaps portions can be reduced somewhat). Restaurant made sure we have tasted the top ingredients available, fresh, full of flavor and perfectly prepared. From that perspective, the price is justified. Perhaps the next time we come, complexity of dishes, their conceptualization, sophistication, will add value and provide an unforgettable experience. 

I have spoken with the owner, who has very ambitious plans for Nautika, but want to honor its heritage and not use shortcuts. First goal was to maintain consistency which was successfully accomplished, exterior was opened to views and surrounding square, interior was slightly refreshed but kept the upscale them and the menu stayed true to original themes. Given the heritage, view, quality of ingredients and level of service, Nutika has the star potential.",,Jul 2015

My main was a small piece of fillet, ordered medium it arrived well done and practically cremated.

There are great views of the wall, fortress and sea. As dusk deepened to night, the floodlighting made everything look stunning and an almost full moon glittered on the sea. 

An excellent and extensive wine list offered an international range of wines and prices from about 30-500 Euros. The Amuse Bouche was not memorable but bread rolls were very good and the naturally spicy olive oil was superb. All our starters were exquisite: truffle pasta, scallops with truffles, thick shrimp soup and an unusual sweet potato soup that one waiter confided he used to have every day for years.

Our mains were more about showing off the superb quality of the ingredients than of sauces or garnishes. Dalmatian lamb chops were butter-soft, Charolais beef fillet equally so, and the veal fillet was also declared good by our picky guests, who both had the same dish.

340 Euros bought us 2 courses each for 4 people, including an 85 Euro bottle of wine; we were too full to consider dessert and had been there for 2 hours by then. Very expensive for Croatia but justified for an anniversary celebration.

I mean,we all know that Nautika was Dubrovnik's best fine dining restaurant in the late '90 and throughout the '00 but I think we were all a bit sceptic when we heard about the new management taking over this institution of Dubrovnik...

Well,no need to be sceptic anymore...the amazing view is still there (in ours opinion,much better and more romantic to that of ex Gil's,now 360°) and the food is still spectacular...from the entry-level till the most expensive dishes, from ""plain"" dishes like the sea bass file till those,a bit more extravagant like the strawberry cake with green paper and aceto balsamico..also,we have to mention that you get to try 4 different extra quality olive oils,one for each dish...

Even though the service in the ""old"" Nautika was very high quality, the new one is exceptional..Ivan,our waiter was very well informed about our meals and Dubrovnik and Marko (we think he is the manager) was really something else...really informative,kind and on top of things but not too intrusive..also,we heard him speak to other guests on different languages...

Overall, Nautika is still Dubrovnik's number 1 in terms of fine and quality dining...it is rather expensive (for Croatian standards) buy it's well worth it...would recommend it to anyone...just be sure to book a table on the main terrace, it's spectacular! A well deserved 5 stars...

Hope you'll enjoy it...",,Jun 2015

Food were superb, we loved cuttlefish salad and lavender mousse dessert was delicious. Service staff had a very good take care. Good place to have dinner.",,Jun 2015
Emily E,"Carson City, Nevada",USA,5,null,null,null,null,"My husband and I were hesitant to eat at such a nice restaurant with our very loud and active 14 month old son but thought we would give it a try. They brought out a very nice high chair and everyone was so very welcoming and accommodating to us. All the waiters and maitre d's came up to our son and smiled at him and gave him attention. I've never written a review here, but the fact that such a nice place didn't scoff at us trying to have a nice meal with our baby really meant a lot. The food was excellent as well but go for the view and the service. You won't be disappointed!",,Jun 2015
Sally876,null,null,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,null,"We ate here on our last night in Dubrovnik. The restaurant is very expensive but definitely worth the visit. A table on the terrace at the side of the restaurant is definitely a better choice as it's away from all the tourists taking photos. The views are amazing and the service is excellent, we were made to feel very special. The food was very good especially the desserts. Excellent choice for a special evening.",,Jun 2015
johnWokinghamUk,wokingham uk,wokingham uk,3,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,"Had dinner there last week, worth going just for the views over the small bay with the cliffs and city walls in the background. Staff were absolutely delightful and couldn't have been more helpful. Unfortunately the food just didn't match a restaurant of this standard. Fish was seriously over cooked and burnt in places. Fillet steak ordered medium arrived well done, vegetable selection and presentation was poor. A great shame, with the setting, staff, table linen, crockery and cutlery this could be a great place but they do need to get the food sorted out.",,Jun 2015
George m,"Zadar, Croatia",Croatia,5,null,null,null,null,"Went there this evening with my friends, since they have not been here before I wanted to show them what this beautiful country has to offer, I called the night before and the on the phone was really kind explaining me the menu and reserving the sea view table for me and my friends even though they were pretty booked. When we arrived the girl at the entrance showed us the table and she kindly invited us to try the wine bar they opened recently. All the other personnel was just as kind, and english proficient, the food is amazing and the view is just stunning. Definitely coming back as soon as possible.",,Jun 2015
Donkey3653,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"This restaurant has recently re opened after a major refurbishment internally, we ate outside overlooing the wall, fort amd the sea, excellent views the only downside was the tourists who can get close to you as they look at the view and take pictures -- but hey ho we are tourists too!

The food and service were excellent, indeed having eaten several times in Dubrovnik this was the best seafood restaurant in town -- or in Nautikas case just outside the town walls.

The portions were good, the quality excellent and value for money amazing.

For any person serious about food who is looking for good seafood, ambience, service etc this is a must go to venue.

I would suggest when you book and book you will have to if you want a table with a view you ask for a table overlooking the wall, fort and sea.",,Jun 2015
Peter J,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"very classy restaurant just outside the city walls of Dubrovnik 
Nice menu that caters for most 
Great value for money considering the class of restaurant 
One point let them down when the asked us for the table back when we were finished eating 
We weren't best pleased about that
But it's very good and definitely recommended",,Jun 2015
Tim B,"Warwickshire, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,"We happened upon the restaurant on our first night in Dubrovnik.

Situated on top of a large cliff just outside the old town it offers a sophisticated and extensive menu with excellent service.

Well worth a visit.",,Jun 2015
