## 🚧 COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### ❌ Don't: Rush Without Korean Partner
**Problem:** Korean platforms require local business registration
**Solution:** Partner with Korean digital agency from day 1

### ❌ Don't: Use Google Translate Only
**Problem:** Poor translations, cultural misunderstandings
**Solution:** Hire professional Korean translator/content creator

### ❌ Don't: Ignore Photo Time
**Problem:** Frustrated staff, rushed guests, bad reviews
**Solution:** Train staff on Korean photography culture

### ❌ Don't: Over-Promote on First Contact
**Problem:** Korean culture values authenticity over hard selling
**Solution:** Soft approach - provide information, let them decide

### ❌ Don't: Expect Immediate Results
**Problem:** Digital presence takes 3-6 months to build momentum
**Solution:** Commit to 12-month strategy, measure quarterly

### ❌ Don't: Copy-Paste Western Strategy
**Problem:** What works in US/EU doesn't work in Korea
**Solution:** Korea-specific approach (Naver > Google, Kakao > WhatsApp)
