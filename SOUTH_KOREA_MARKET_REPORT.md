## 📊 PART 6: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### 6.1 Dubrovnik Restaurant Korean Market Presence

**Current Status:**
❌ **ZERO competitors** focused on Korean market
❌ **ZERO Korean digital presence** across Dubrovnik restaurants
❌ **ZERO Korean language materials** available
❌ **ZERO Kakao Map listings** found

**Result:** 🏆 **FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE AVAILABLE**

### 6.2 European Benchmark - What Others Are Doing

**Paris Michelin Restaurants:**
- ✅ Dianping presence (Chinese)
- ✅ WeChat accounts
- ✅ Asian influencer programs
- ✅ Multi-language menus
- ❌ Limited Korean-specific focus

**Barcelona Tapas Restaurants:**
- ✅ Instagram Korean hashtags
- ✅ Korean travel blogger partnerships

**Santorini Restaurants:**

**Impact:** Reservation communication, in-restaurant experience

**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Translation apps on-site (Papago, Google Translate)
- [ ] Korean menu (printed)
- [ ] Key phrases training for staff
- [ ] "We speak English" messaging in Korean content
- [ ] KakaoTalk for pre-arrival communication (can use translation)
- [ ] Hire Korean-speaking staff (if volume justifies) - summer seasonal hire?

---

#### Challenge 2: Platform Access Requirements
**Problem:** Korean platforms require business registration
**Impact:** Cannot directly create accounts

**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Partner with Korean digital agency
- [ ] Agency creates and manages accounts
- [ ] Accept 15-20% markup on services
- [ ] Build long-term agency relationship
- [ ] Consider Korean subsidiary (only if scaling massively)

---

#### Challenge 3: Cultural Differences
**Problem:** Service expectations, dining customs, communication style
**Impact:** Guest satisfaction, reviews

**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Korean culture training for staff (1-2 hour workshop)
- [ ] Understand Korean dining etiquette
- [ ] Photo-taking time (expect longer dining duration)
- [ ] Respect for Instagram/social media documentation
- [ ] Gentle service (less intrusive than Western style)
- [ ] Group accommodations (Koreans often dine in groups of 3-6)

---

#### Challenge 4: Seasonality & Availability
**Problem:** Korean tourists peak during shoulder seasons; may affect booking availability
**Impact:** May miss opportunities if fully booked with other markets

**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Hold 2-4 tables for Korean advance bookings
- [ ] Early bird reservation encouragement (Koreans plan ahead)
- [ ] Premium pricing for peak views (Korean market accepts this)
- [ ] Waitlist management via KakaoTalk
- [ ] Flexible table timing (earlier dinner service for photos)

---

#### Challenge 5: Competition Eventually Wakes Up
**Problem:** Once successful, competitors will copy strategy
**Impact:** First-mover advantage diminishes

**Mitigation:**

- [ ] Become #1 associated brand for Dubrovnik Korean dining
- [ ] Continuous content creation (stay top-of-mind)

---

#### Challenge 6: ROI Measurement Difficulty

**Impact:** Unclear which channels work best

**Mitigation:**

- [ ] Ask at reservation: "How did you hear about us?"

### 10.2 Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- ✅ Instagram optimization (minimal cost, high potential)
- ✅ Organic content strategy
- ✅ Micro-influencer partnerships (small commitments)

**Medium Risk:**
- ⚠️ Kakao/Naver setup (requires upfront investment, unknown conversion)
- ⚠️ Agency partnerships (monthly commitments)

**High Risk:**
- 🔴 Major platform ad spend without testing (defer until Tier 2)
- 🔴 Hiring full-time Korean staff (defer until volume proven)
- 🔴 Large-scale events/promotions (defer)

**Recommended Approach:** START SMALL → TEST → SCALE
