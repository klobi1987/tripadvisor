Anonymous,"Calgary, Canada",Canada,5,null,null,null,null,"Dubravka 1836 was an absolute win. We scored a table right beside the ocean, and when the breeze got a bit chilly they handed us blankets like we were VIP burritos. The service was perfect. The servers were smiling, friendly, attentive, and somehow managed to be helpful without hovering like seagulls eyeing your fries. You could tell they actually liked their jobs, which was refreshing.

Atmosphere? Check. Stunning view of the ocean, the city walls, and Fort Lovrijenac making me feel like I was in a postcard or possibly a Game of Thrones episode. Then the food arrived and wow. Cooked to perfection, tasted amazing, and looked good enough to make me pause before eating just to appreciate it. The best part? The bill did not make me question my life choices when I checked my bank account the next day.

Highly recommend. Come for the view, stay for the food, and enjoy being wrapped in a blanket like a happy, well-fed tourist.",,Oct 2025

But the real magic begins when the food arrives. The Dalmatian ham was a standout: delicately sliced, perfectly cured, and rich with flavor that speaks of tradition and care. The steak was equally impressive—succulent, expertly cooked, and seasoned to perfection. And the grilled squid was spectacular. Tender, it was easily one of the best seafood dishes I’ve had in Croatia.

This is most assuredly not the case at Dubravka. Everything we ate was beautifully presented and delicious - in particular the tuna salad starter and fish stew. Service was perfect - professional, friendly and well-paced. The house white wine (by the litre/or half litre carafe) was also excellent. Portions are generous and pricing is extremely reasonable considering the location.
We had originally tried to make a booking online but found availability seemed extremely limited, but when we enquired in person at the front desk we were easily able to book for the evening we wanted - and were also lucky enough to be allocated a table on the terrace adjacent to the wall overlooking the sea with lovely views, so a perfect meal all round.

The staff is super friendly and efficient. We never made reservations, and yet they've always had a table for us. Feel very special and welcome each time.

They serve breakfast until 11:30 am and the omelets were very nice. We also got a pizza for lunch one day, generous size and fresh ingredients. One evening we stopped here just for dessert! We tried the Dubrovnik famous rozata - it is similar to crème caramel, custard pudding, or flan (although we think it is lighter than a flan). Wish we had room to each enjoy the rozata and not shared; it was divine.

Bourn07,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,2,null,null,null,null,"I must start by saying that this review is of our feelings about our meals, and not the way the manager handled these, which was very professional and much more than we expected.

I am afraid we found the veal schnitzel very dry, the salmon fillet hardly cooked in the centre, the Swiss chard potatoes a ‘mush’ and the potato gratin not particularly fresh.

Seeing our half eaten meals the waiter asked if all was OK and when we, politely, explained he immediately fetched the manager. We explained again and the manager offered alternatives. We said ‘thank you’ but we just wanted the bill and he refused to let us pay anything. We offered to pay again, but he insisted that there would be no payment and also gave us a discount card should we return to that, or one of their partner restaurants.

Throughout this he apologised and was courteous and professional. 

The only comment I would make is that the manager said the Swiss chard potatoes should look like that. I looked up the dish online, afterwards, to see lovely cubes of potato on lightly cooked dark green Swiss chard - not the slightly luminous green ‘mush’ with indistinguishable contents we were served (which is also commented on in another review), so this dish may be worth a rethink.

There are many, many reviewers who praise this restaurant so, maybe, we were unlucky.",,Jun 2025
Ethereal11,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Definitely the best restaurant in Dubrovnik: we've been here three times.
I've been the kind of person to have a best restaurant-but Dubravka 1836 changes all of this!
Forget about the restaurants in the Old City, this one is just outside the old city-very close to the Pile Gate and the food is incredible, and the staff friendly and very well trained.
The food was of excellent quality and delicious, and very good portion size.
The location-if you're sitting outside is magical no matter where you sit.
We had a pizza the first time we came to Dubrovnik and it was delicious.
We came to dine here on our last night in Dubrovnik and the meal was memorable, it was Schnitzel with chard mash and it was delicious. 
It was close to sunset and sitting outside, we felt the magic of the city as the sun went down. But it wasn't just that, the staff made it memorable by being kind, attentive and caring.
Don't waste time and money in restaurants in the old city, it's really not worth it, come here instead.",,May 2025

The staff member serving used the same scoop for peanut ice cream and then other flavours without cleaning the scoop in between. When she did put the scoop in water, it was dumped into the same water as other scoops so all would be contaminated. Anyone buying another flavour thinking they were OK to eat it because it had no nuts in it would unintentionally be eating small amounts of peanut ice cream. This is so dangerous and irresponsible.

It wasn't till the bill came when I saw that my main dish was more expensive than the one I'd ordered, and I also got charged for the beans, that I realised what had happened. It didn't matter, all was good anyway, but I probably should have pointed it out to the waiter at the time. The staff were attentive and also gave us discount on the end bill as we had bought a City Pass. So, all in all, a pleasant experience.",,Aug 2024

Tipping was a must which is ridiculous…
Tried to pay by card. The waitress explained that regarding tipping I have four options on the terminal: 5, 10, 15, 20%. I told her I do not want to tip and pressed the 5th option with 0%. And it was not working. The waitress restarted the payment process and explained again that I have four options on the terminal as the tip is not included in the bill and asked if I understand english at all. She totally ignored that I do not want to tip. At the 4th payment attempt I chose 5% in order we could leave. They did not deserve it at all…

We had the worst experience at this establishment. My friend and I went to get ice cream there and well it was moderately busy. The staff were incredibly rude to us. We were smiling and trying to explain what we were after and they were very sharp and abrupt with us. My friend asked to try two ice cream flavours and she gave her a nasty look and abruptly said “only one!”. The ice cream scoops were really small for the price. We were waiting to pay for a few minutes and we had to get multiple staff members attention before we were able to pay. That was the worst experience in this country. Too much attitude and I will not be returning and would not recommend to a single soul.

We always make a reservation for our meal on the last night but on the other nights we don't and we are always seated within 5 minutes of arriving. As a whiskey drinker the smoked old fashioned is still the best i have had anywhere and the lavender spritz is also a delight. Overall this is a top place with top service.

The only negative of the restaurant was that there was quite a few pigeons which can be off putting when having dinner especially as they come very close to you by the wall.

The focaccia bread to start with was delightful. I opted for a pizza whilst my wife opted for “Spaghetti with tomate sauce” which was listed as a hot starter but the portion size was certainly a main which was great. Both dishes tasted really nice and the prices for a restaurant of that quality of food and views were really good and reasonable.

But what made dining here so memorable was the kind, attentive service of the wait staff. All had a sense of humor and all were attentive. We dined here 3 of the 4 day we had in Dubrovnik.

The quality of the food was excellent. I had the seafood rissotto on two days and a pizza on the third. I'd rate my entrees a 5 (on a 5-point scale). My wife had the tuna and chicken caesar salad. She'd rate the tuna salad a 5 and the chicken salad a 4. 

But what made this special was how you were treated-- greeted warmly and politely and made to feel as part of a family.

Mario was our waiter on our third and last visit on the sunny afternoon of March 23. We enjoyed a repartee that not only enhanced our dining experience but made me feel especially fond of this city.

There were a lot of waiters but strangely there was too much time between drinks and had to wave someone down for service.
Food was pretty good. Seafood salads, octopus salad, pastas seem good.
Rib eye steak was extremely average, a couple of us had them and they are far too thin for a restaurant so doesn’t matter how you want it cooked, it’ll turn up cooked and chewy. This type of place should be offering a thick cut rib eye, or filet. Owners research every steak in the USA.
Potato gratin side probably the best thing there.

The coffee was a little overpriced for what it was and the service was pretty average also. It took ages to order and ages to pay the bill here.

As a restaurant in a prime tourist spot, we were a little concerned that the restaurant might rely too heavily on its location – but the food was good, and we enjoyed both the seafood salad.

It's a lovely restaurant set in a great location with a view of the castle and fort.

Having had drinks, and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and aware of tables filling up around us with people dressed for dinner, we experienced professional friendly service with no pressure to leave or order food.

A guitarist, Zamit, set up next to our table & played acoustic numbers. We sat and listened and enjoyed his whole set. He was fantastic and definitely a reason we stayed and went on to order food. We ended u getting chatting to him as we were guessing the songs, he even did a request. This led to us chatting to a waiter about songs as he served us our last round of drinks & Zamit packed up. 

We had 1 evening in Dubrovnik and we were so happy to have found this place! Shame we weren't staying longer as I think we'd have been back multiple times. I will definitely go back if I go back to Dubrovnik.

We received in the end half a breakfast and he pretty much ignored us, I would go as far as saying he was hostile.

The views would have been better when there was still some daylight but none the less night views are pretty beautiful if you are lucky to get a terrace sitting. The food is decent and the services are good. There is only couple seating at the end of the wall so families can't get the best of the tables. Since we also visited Panorama which belongs to the same Nautica group, we got 10% discount on the entire bill. If you happen to visit any of the 3 restaurants then don't forget to ask for a discount voucher if you plan to visit another one later.

GARRY P,"Hastings, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,3.0,4.0,4.0,null,"""Dubravka 1836"" is one of 4 Dubrovnik restaurants under common ownership (see also my review of ""Arsenal"") and is perfectly located close to the famous Pile Gate, overlooking a rocky cove and fortifications including Fort Bokar. The restaurant is very popular and it's certainly worth reserving in advance in high season, given the number of people we saw waiting hopefully at the entrances for tables to become fee. Fortunately, we reserved in advance and managed to secure a table directly overlooking the cove for both dinner and lunch, which I can recommend. 

There is an extensive menu (available online) as the restaurant is open, for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At dinner, we shared a starter of a cold fish platter followed by mains of King Prawns in a tomato and caper sauce and a hot fish/seafood platter. The food was perfectly cooked and I particularly enjoyed the prawns, but beware, as they are head and shell on and it's a little challenging to avoid getting coated with sauce, although the staff kindly provided a bib. Desserts were excellent and we enjoyed a bottle of the Maraslina Miljas white wine, priced at HRK230 (c.£29). We enjoyed the meal so much that we celebrated with Grand Marnier and the final price for 2 persons for dinner was HRK 1,184 (c.£148), ex. tip. I should add that the service was friendly, attentive and professional throughout. 

A few days later, we returned for lunch and had the same shared starter and a mains of the mixed fish/seafood platter, which was good but less enjoyable and flavoursome than the King Prawns in sauce. This time the final bill for 2 was HRK 1,049 (c.£130). Obviously, the restaurant is quite expensive, but typical for Dubrovnik and we found the food, drink and service to be reliably good and with the added advantage of a great location.",,Jul 2022
Helena L,"Malmesbury, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"This restaurant is sited just outside Pile Gate, one of the two main entrances to Dubrovnik Old Town. It sells ice cream which was just heavenly. The portion size was generous and the cost was fantastic: one scope 18 Kuna (£2), Two scopes 26 kuna (£3). 

Good flavors: orange / green apple / pineapple. 

I will most defiantly be going back.",,Aug 2022

When she couldn’t stomach her main meal, they took it off our bill which was completely above and beyond what we expected as we were totally willing to pay for the uneaten food.

This is a more expensive higher-end restaurant. We ordered an expensive dish on the menu mistakenly assuming it would be a 2 person portion because of the price.

 Having also eaten all the complimentary bread, we were still hungry after and mentioned this to the waiter when wanting to pay the bill. We had a lovely surprise when the manager came over and was so nice to us and offered a complimentary meal. We were blown away how nice the staff are. 

The food was great: we had fish soup (mixed feelings), seafood platter and the complimentary lamb with amazing sauce! (Gordon Ramsay would be proud)

Lucy A,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,2,null,null,null,null,"We came here for breakfast and had reserved 4 days in advance and received a table on the wall edge over looking the view. They ask you to confirm your reservation the day before via email. 

The breakfast menu is not vast and has more ‘set meal/ menu’ with a hot drink, orange juice, bread basket fruit bowl and a choice of omelette or egg. The menu could really do with some more options and choice - even a choice of different ingredient in the omelette. Orange juice glass was tiny and coffee didn’t taste good. The menu is the same as what you see online on their website. 

You can still get the same view in the public area and space next to the restaurant. The location is just outside the old city close to the taxi ranks. 

The service was really unfriendly and unwelcoming we had a gentleman serve us who was just so miserable and made us feel so unwelcome and service was slow. 

We paid around 180 kuna for the 2 ‘set’ breakfasts. Happy with the view but wouldn’t recommend or return. 

We were also told that we should of received a 10% off voucher with our bill for the other restaurants in the ‘Nautika’ group which we did not. We later went to Panorama restaurant (which is the same owner/ company) where we would of been able to use this discount.

They don't have a kids menu but our waitress who was lovely recommended a starter as they are fairly big sizes. So my daughter who is 8 had the lasagne - and that portion would have filled me up! I had the fresh tagliatelle which was delicious, and my husband had the aged steak which was beautifully cooked with green beans and hash browns. 
Considering its location I was expecting the price to be fairly high, but I would say it was mid range. Very good quality....

Hrvoje M,"Zagreb, Croatia",Croatia,5,null,null,null,null,"Dubravka 1836 was recommended to us by employees of hotel we stayed in. We went for a lunch today, July 14th 2020 at 13:30 and from from the moment we arrived, we left all awfull reviews at Tripadvisor behind us-we were welcomed with a big smile and set at the table of our choice. We started with a large macchiato (a coffe with warm milk but without a foam) - it was perfectly prepaired, just as we asked.
For a lunch, we ordered 2 x grilled calamari/squid, 1x fench fries, 1x boiled potatos with mangel, 2x seson salads, 0.5L of white wine and 0.75L of sparkling water. The food was delicious, wine and spakling water were perfectly chilled/cold and felt great with our food. Waiters were nice, polite, with huge smiles under their COVID-19 masks and very customer oriented - they were filling our glasses with wine the moment they noticed that they were allmost empty, but they did it wery discretely and unobtrusively. 
I have read all bad reviews for Dubravka 1836 and all I can say are three things:

1. Dubravka 1836 is not a 1, 2 or 3 Michelin star restaurant. If you want to have a fancy and expensive lunch or dinner and be hungry afterwards, Dubravka 1836 is not a restorant for you

2. Communication and mutual understanding is crucial key for avoiding any missunderstanding - speak clearly what do you want and you'll get it. We asked for a large macchiato with warm milk but without any foam and it was perfect.
Anybody can make a mistake-if your order was lost, if your coffe was not as good as you expected, if you ordered noodles and got ordinary pasta or spaggeti, talk to the waiter or restaurant manager at once and you'll be compensated this way or another - don't write awfull reviews next day or next week.

3. If you are an ordinary guest who wants to enjoy in tasty lunch/dinner in heart of Dubrovnik, or you just want to enjoj in coffe and cake at great location by the sea and with trully afordable prices, Dubravka 1836 is a perfect spot for you. Read first two points again, come to Dubravka 1836 and you'll won't be dissapointed, I promisse! :-))",,Jul 2020

I then had their John Dory fish dinner (very good) and my wife had the steak gratin which was cooked perfectly and quite delicious! Both dinners were good size portions and enjoyable. We shared dessert (a chocolate walnut cake that actually was more a walnut cake with chocolate icing). The cake was sweet without being overly sweet (much more European style than American style cake). The view of the sea and the city walls was perfect! Since we are here in mid February the place wasn't totally overrun with tourists and our leisurely lunch was exactly as we had hoped. The only downside is for those that sit outside along the wall in front (as we were since I had reserved a table) you have to put up with the pigeons that sit on the wall and constantly eye your food. People must feed them occasionally since they all seemed very unafraid of people though I did not see anyone feeding them when we were there.

My husband had the grilled veggie platter but it was less than enjoyable (I can't remember what all was on it but it had a lot of egg plant and it was so unappetizing that I didn't even take a picture of it - which is strange for me).

I was extremely impressed all round, especially with the service.
My food was delicious and exactly what I expected from the menu description.

Situated just outside the city walls, with an absolutely stunning view, friendly staff and good food.

We hadn’t pre booked a table but were lucky to be shown to a table down the side of the restaurant, opposite the city walls & gate entrance. A lot of other customers were coming in wanting/waiting for a seat on the terrace, and were either turned away as it was full, or asked to join a queue around the front. I have to say that I much preferred where we were seated, the views were spectacular and actually it was less crowded & there weren’t hundreds of tourists watching whilst you ate! The only slight issue was the customers who smoked - because there was a canopy style roof above, smoke drifted around. However, because we were sat right by the edge & the open air, it wasn’t too offensive.

The prices are so reasonable and i was given a 10% off promotion card to use for the entirety of my stay, which could be used across all 3 of their restaurants (the other 2 being located in the Old Town harbour and at the top of the Cable Car), which definitely gave even more incentive to go back!

For breakfast its great value and although about 5 set choices its a good enough selection to please anyone - and the coffee is particularly good. Lunch and dinner is different in that there is a huge selection ranging from good pizzas to excellent fresh fish. Stand out dishes were the tuna steak which was perfectly cooked rare, shrimps and pasta which was superb and a favourite of everyone and the best rated dinner was John Dory which was so fresh.

I make a booking months prior to our visit and the exact table I requested was reserved for us. The wine recommended by our charming waiter was very good.

My husband ordered the prawns done the traditional way in tomato sauce and it was nothing spectacular. Our meal was just average but maybe we just did not order the best items on the menu.

A W,"Lichfield, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,3,null,null,null,null,"The location is beautiful overlooking the sea and city walls. There's a good choice of seating both inside and out, with the inside area being more shady and cooler but also more like a terrace. The area was spotlessly clean and there were many waiters. Service was speedy and polite. I had the local sparkling rose and my partner a beer, but after tasting my fruity wine also opted for a glass. 

We both ordered tuna salad, after trying this previously at the panorama restaurant at the top of the mount by the cable car. It was no comparison at all and had very little tuna; when I mentioned this to the waiter he simply shrugged and smiled. The tuna didnt feel fresh, more flaked like you would find in a tin. It was mostly lettuce leaves all of the same type, with limited cherry tomatoes and a spray of olives. There was also a bread basket with six slices two of which were polenta, on the side and a ceaser sauce which had little taste. This was a stark difference to the tuna salad we had at the panorama and the relationship in the sister restaurant held no unison with regard to the quality of food on offer. The price which was at the higher end however, still did.

Chelsea M,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"Me and my two friends visited this restaurant in May 2019. I had also visited with my boyfriend in June 2017. 

Location - This restaurant is located right on the Pile gate, so right in the centre of everything that is going on and super easy to find. This area is busy as it's where tours meet and things like that BUT mostly due to the amazing view. You can be seated right on the edge which looks out to the beautiful blue sea and buildings of Dubrovnik. 

Food - We came for breakfast one morning and couldn't have asked for more, plenty to choose from and plenty of food turned up once ordered. My friend ordered an omelette and we also got a lot of bread, spreads and fruit! We loved it that much, we came back for dinner and I had Spaghetti Bolognese. I can honestly say it was the best spaghetti I've ever had - really really tasty! I also had apple pie for dessert, again just amazing. My friends also said their meals were incredible. 

Staff - All staff were really friendly and helpful, no issues whatsoever. 

Other - When we visited, the weather wasn't the best, but on each chair was a red blanket, super cosy and just a really nice touch. There is a large outside seating area, but the inside is just as beautiful. Considering the location, the view and quality of the food, it was really reasonably priced!

stian h,Oslo,Oslo,3,3.0,3.0,2.0,null,"We went to Dubravka for lunch when we arrived in Dubrovnik. The restaurant is located right outside the Pile gate, so the location is pretty much perfect and as the restaurant is quite large it is easy to get a table. Big plus for location and availability. Basically this is an average restaurant for tourists (ie. tourist trap) who are not very picky about their food. 

I´m always sceptical of restaurants that have examples of the dessert menu in a glass container. Good restaurants do not usually do this, but Dubravka does. So the expectations for the food were not very high. 

We ordered the veal fillet with french fries and vegetables. The veal was pretty much tasteless, but quite juicy and the herb butter on top was good. The french fries were soft and did not taste anything and was quite disappointing. The vegetables were just okay. The view was definitely the best part of the experience and not the food. There are so many restaurants in old town Dubrovnik with more charm and way better food - although the view cannot be beaten.

Simples87,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,3,null,null,null,null,"Lovely location and tasty breakfast options. However, despite all the positive reviews from previous travellers about the staff, we found the service bad. For example, once a table right at the end of the terrace with the best views became available, we requested to move there, but the waiters said it was 'reserved' and placed a reservation card on the table. 2 mins later, some new guests arrived and all of a sudden , the table became available! We over heard the waiters saying that the guests had 'cancelled' their booking within 2 mins of us requesting the table. Extremely hard to believe. The rude staff didnt want to move us. Simple. 

In terms of the breakfast itself, it was tasty and value for money. However you are paying for the view, not the breakfast and advise you not to sit near the tables near the right hand side where the general public are taking pictures (all the visitors get off the coaches and head straight to that spot and you feel like your eating your breakfast with them staring at you )",,May 2019

Fortunately for us they were able to accommodate us on their covered (heated) terrace which was perfect as it was a warm but seriously rainy day in Dubrovnik. 

I cannot be positive enough about how great they were. The service was incredible, which given we were a large group with complicated dietary requirements was impressive. They were so friendly and responded to every request with a smile.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous, with a mural of the town walls and views of the walls and the fort from the uncovered terrace

The food was great, very generous portions compared to the other place we ate in the Old Town. Fresh and tasty seafood and ingredients. Everything cooked to perfection. Everyone loved their food. The two local wines they recommended were the best we had in a restaurant throughout the holiday and not overly expensive either.

They also brought out a dessert personalised for my friend at the end which was such a nice touch.

We had a few drinks then decided to order. My wife had the Prawns Dubrovnik style and was given a bib and extra hand wipes, she needed both. It's a dish to get messy with but was delicious. I had the Penne Aribatta, reasonable portion but so tasty. Plenty of garlic and a touch of spice. I make it at home the other way around, but this was perfectly balanced. 

You can pay in Euros which was handy, and we did and left a good tip, well deserved. As the cool evening came in blankets were nicely offered and heaters came out. A keyboard and trumpet duo started to play great mood music. We could of stayed there all evening.

Also we had veal and it was really tender and the sauce that came with was just great. 
Also before you order i would recommend you to ask for the less salt. Personally i thought less salt tasted better. 
For desert we had homemade apple cake. Apple cake was okay little too sweet for me but it was good.

LANewsboy,"Los Angeles, California",USA,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"My wife and I spent a week in Dubrovnik before a Dalmatian Coast cruise and we went to Dubravka 1836 at the recommendation of our travel agent, Peter Hazdovac of Adriatic Travel in San Pedro, Calif. 

Peter is Croatian-American and has been to Dubrovnik many times. He called Dubravka his favorite restaurant, and we could see why. It's in a great spot, with a huge, tree-shaded terrace with views of the the sea with the city walls. We ended up eating there three times, we enjoyed it that much. 

And here's the main reason we enjoyed Dubravka so much: Josip Grizely, the co-manager in during the day. 

When we first walked into the restaurant, Josip greeted us and I said the only words of Croatian that I knew, ""dober dan,"" which means ""good afternoon."" His face lit up, he jokingly called me a ""countryman"" and led us to a table. During our meal, he would come by to briefly visit and check on us. 

Later in the week, I asked him to help us get reservations for four at another excellent restaurant the company owns, Arsenal, overlooking the harbor. He got us an excellent table and at the end of the meal, we were shocked when a dessert sampler was brought to the table, courtesy of Josip. Talk about good customer service. 

So, some suggestions: Try Dubravka, ask for ""Josip with the glasses"" and greet him with ""dober dan."" Do the same with any Croatian you meet and you will find the interaction much richer, and more fun.",,Sep 2018

For desert we had one of the cakes of the day the apple pie which was delicious. The pasta dish I would say was a large portion, but the squid was smaller, and so if you are hungry perhaps lean towards the pasta dishes.

We ordered grilles seabass and it was dry and didnt taste at all like grill at all, more like baked. It was the WROST FISH DISH i had in Croatia and I have had more than 10 times fish dish in my trip here. The fish dish came with some broccoli its the most terrible broccoli I've eaten in a restaurants its mushy and tasteless. Better not to serve this kind of veggies if they dont even know how to simply make brokolli s, replace with salad! 

We also ordered a margarita pizza it was too salty. A simple pizza but not done well either. Save your money go eat else where there are plenty of restaurants with great views.

The food was very disappointing. My boyfriend was very disappointed with his prawns and his measly bowl of rice that looked almost conjealed. I ordered a lasagne Bolognese as this was one of the only things within my budget. It was dry, it was chewy and it was crusty and not in a good way.

The food was excellent and I’d definitely recommend the wild garlic prawns with squid ink pasta. Don’t be put off by the colour, it tastes pretty much the same as regular pasta.

Given it’s proximity to the bus station and city walls, it is quite pricey but we thought it was well worth it. Total 400kn for two drinks and two mains.

Worth noting that this group of restaurants give out a 10% discount card so if you visit one of them make sure to pick one up.",,Jul 2018

When we approach the Dubravka 1836 restaurant, we are asked if we have a reservation. While we say no, the manager decides that he will accommodate us. He leads us to a table for two along the wall overlooking the ocean and the great wall of Dubrovnik.

My wife loves her dish of vegetables grilled to perfection. My king prawns are excellent. And, the ambience. We are seated next to the duet of keyboard and muted trumpet playing great old favorites. I begin a dialog with the trumpet player by naming the tunes they are playing. As they start a new tune, I call out the name, and the trumpet player nods his approval.

This is an excellent and very popular restaurant with food, location, and ambience. If you get to Dubrovnik, I recommend Dubraka 1836 to you.

You must book your table in peak season. Be prepared for an amazing dining experience: the view alone is spectacular (check subset times).
We even had fireworks that lit up the sky/wall/fort. Even though the Croatians lost their game they still celebrated and were so very excited (though there were still people that were devastated/crying).
Meals we ordered: several seafood risottos (one said it was the BEST she has ever had), grilled prawns, mussels (several people had this and were even given bibs), grilled chicken, creamy spaghetti (several) with (small) prawns. Everyone LOVED their meal: NOT ONE COMPLAINT!
Luckily I had mosquito repellent in my bag (for everyone) as there were lots of mosquitos!

It has excellent views of the old city walls and a small beach. Early evening views are probably best.

The live music was the best we heard in Croatia. 

Entertainment aside, the food was rather pedestrian and boring although the menu was extensive. My feeling is that it caters for tourists who probably will never be return.

The waiters were polite and spoke English fluently.

In brief, go for the view but not for the food.",,May 2018

The restaurant is in a very lovely setting, just outside the City Walls at Pile Gate with stunning views out across the Adriatic Sea. 
We decided to eat outside on the terrace and were quite happy not having a table next to the low walls because the pigeons can be quite annoying! 
On our first visit my husband had the tuna pizza whilst I had prawns with spaghetti in a cream sauce. On our second visit my husband had the penne arrabbiatta and I had chicken with tagliatelle in a tomato sauce. All of our food was freshly cooked, delicious and huge portions.
On both occasions we decided to treat ourselves to a 1L carafe of house red wine which was very tasty.
Although the restaurant was busy we weren't rushed. An extra nice gesture is that the staff put out patio heaters and offered blankets as the temperature suddenly drops when the sun goes down at this time of year.
All of the staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful. I would particularly like to praise Anita who served us on our first visit and to say that she has a lovely singing voice!
This restaurant is very reasonably priced bearing in mind its location and quality of food and staff. It is obviously very popular and so at certain times of the day you might have to wait a while to have a table. But you won't be disappointed!!

There was this restaurant literally right outside the entrance to the moat in front of the city walls and we were hungry so we thought we'd give it a try strictly out of convenience. It ended up being our favorite restaurant and we came back over and over again the whole week that we were there. First of all, the restaurant is perched on the cliff so you can sit out on the terrace and have the most breathtakingly beautiful view of the sea and the Old City walls and the fortress on the opposite cliff. If you go during the evening, the sky changes from a lighter blue to a deep blue velvet and the moon shines over the water and the fortress walls are lit up around you. The swifts (similar to a swallow) will fly by as fast as lightening as day turns to night. Up on the terrace a trio of musicians start playing around 8 PM and the saxophone's beautiful music truly makes you feel as if you are on a romantic movie set. At this point, I'm good with a glass of wine, just wanting to pinch myself that I am even there but yes, there is food, delicious food, prepared perfectly, and they even had some suitable choices for one of our party who is vegetarian. The menu is considered Mediterranean casual, with pasta, salads, pizzas and seafood. Something for everybody. The service was excellent, the waiters were friendly and helpful without being overbearing, We did eat inside the Old City walls too, but found prices to be much higher than what we found here so we were really happy to make this ""our"" magical restaurant!",,Aug 2017

CarlCymru,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,3,null,null,null,null,"Location is stunning and food was very good - we had lunch. A large beer, fish platter and a chicken breast salad cost around £40 which we felt was expensive, but worth it due to quality and location.

The main issue on paying was that the waiter, without asking pressed ‘pay in GBP’, meaning that the exchange rate was set by the Croatian bank (I’m unsure whether the restaurant make any money from this or whether he thought it was being helpful). The meal ended up costing almost £3 extra which upset me, as my bank doesn’t charge any commission (most charge 2.99%) for foreign transactions.

Sorry about the rant, but important to mention as this could work out £10+ if you had dinner with wine etc. or if a family were dining.

The card issue left a bitter taste in my mouth, hence the rating.

Daria B,"Frankfurt, Germany",Germany,3,null,null,null,null,"We came to the place because of wonderful TripAdvisor reviews and got really disappointed. 
There are a few options of sets for breakfast on the menu. I took an option with eggs with cheese and ham, bread and jams. Eggs were somehow way too fatty and cheese was just on top of an egg, not really melted or anything and didn't taste like anything. My bf had omelette with tomatoes, fresh fruits and bread with jams. His omelette was just average. Jams are served in cute little jars. Coffee was not good, tasted more like an instant coffee and latte macchiato was served in a normal coffee cup, so there was no difference to cappuccino at all. 
It's a great idea to have such sets for breakfast, it's rather cheap, but the taste is average or even below average. 
If you're happy just with bread and jams, then it might be a great place for you, but if you expect a bit more from a breakfast probably it's worth it to go somewhere else.",,Sep 2017

The location was so perfect, right in front of the walls to old town with a view overlooking the beach, you feel like royalty looking over from your castle as you eat your food. Our table was perfectly placed against the wall and it was a very romantic setting. 

We ordered the truffle ravioli for starters and the gourmet meat plate (both to share and we ordered the same on both nights as it was so nice) with sides of mushrooms and steamed vegetables (as the meat plate already came with croquettes). 

As romantic as this place really is it is also perfect for families. Service was on point and you couldn't fault it and when we left they even gave us a 10% off voucher for their sister restaurant at the top of the cable car. It was reasonably priced for the location and quality of the food and we ended up paying around 500 kuna for 2 including alcohol which we didn't think was bad at all. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Lara R,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,null,"We didn't book, but were seated after a ten minute wait, which was okay, but we were told to go to the other side of the restaurant entrance to be seated. The restaurant is very busy, our table overlooked part of the bay, which is just beautiful. I had a greek salad for a starter which was pretty good, my husband had beef carpaccio, which was tasty, but laden with mustard. He still liked it, but I would not have liked it with mustard at all, I prefer my beef carpaccio with thinly sliced celery, lemon juice and slivers of parmesan. Our waiter Mario was very friendly.

For mains my husband had Tuna steak, was asked how he prefers it, and said medium rare, but the fish is cut so thin, it came well done. The children were a bit tired by this point, so we did not send it back. I had a seafood mix, which was actually good, the scallop was a bit overdone, but the prawn was succulent, the octopus very good, as was the white fish and salmon. Vegetables a bit bland, and overcooked, but not unpalatable.

Whilst the food was not terrible, it was rather expensive, but I guess you pay for the location. Service was reasonable, we asked for butter for my youngest daughter, but it never arrived, however the waiter apologised when he remembered he forgot the butter. The atmosphere is pretty amazing though, it is bustling, and there was live music, a bit of jazz with a trumpeter and keyboard, were pretty good, we enjoyed that.",,Aug 2017

Andrew P,null,null,3,2.0,4.0,3.0,null,"Many many years ago, in South London, I received an A in English Literature GCSE. The book we were asked to study was ""Lord of the Flies"" and I very proudly managed to get an A without reading the book. True story. In the lessons leading up to the exam, my English teacher would discuss the themes of the book and basically told everyone in the class that the book's themes were a reflection of world politics at the time however just to be annoying, I argued that the book reflected religion, the perceptions of heaven and hell. I had no idea what I was talking about as I never actually read the book and my teacher kept telling me that I was wrong and if I wrote that in the exam I would fail.

Exam day, I sit down with the book in front of me as the clock starts ticking. Everyone around me is writing away with their prepared notes at hand. I sit there not knowing what to do. I open the book to the first page and start reading. 5 minutes later and I'm bored. I have 2 hours for this exam, I don't have enough time to read the book so I decide just to go for it. It was at this moment I had a choice; do I write about Churchill and the politics that I was told to write about or will I write about heaven and hell? I decided to write about heaven and hell. I wanted to test my teacher's theory to see if I actually wrote a valid argument, would I still fail? Then to my amazement, I got an A. For blagging my way through the school year without reading the syllabus then writing random rubbish, I was awarded with an A. Enter my smug face into the next English class.

Now, that was probably a sign that I could get by for the rest of my life without reading things properly. Well thanks to Dubravka, I may have finally learnt my lesson for if I read the menu correctly, I might've enjoyed my meal a bit more. Although I suspect everything else on the menu may also have been equally average.

Following a long day exploring the lovely Old Town, cute girlfriend and I had already decided that we will end our day at Dubravka for our last meal in Dubrovnik following a recommendation from our AirBNB host. We had just finished walking around the city walls, we were tired, it was hot and we were hungry. We arrive at Dubravka and have a quick glance at the menu by the entrance before going in. The menu was a surprising 10 pages or so. There was so much to choose from yet nothing was standing out as a signature dish or a must have. I was unsure. Cute girlfriend was unsure. I was too tired to look for another place to eat so I was reluctant to go anywhere else but I was compelled to leave. I was just about to turn to leave before the hostess caught us looking at the menu and offered us 10% off our meal. Suckers for a bargain we decided just to go for it.

We were seated immediately at quite a nice candle lit table in the middle of the outdoor restaurant with an amazing view of the sea and Old town Walls. Once seated, I looked at cute girlfriend and she was happy. I was happy. This was nice. For our last night in Dubrovnik at the exact moment of the sunset, this was a perfect and romantic setting for the occasion.

The very polite and happy waiter places the menus in front of us. Despite spending 5 minutes beforehand looking at the menu deciding what we could have, this was crunch time. I needed to make a decision. I started having a good look at everything then noticed the prices. It wasn't cheap. Although I had a 10% discount voucher in my hand, the prices were still a bit high and so I discreetly count how much money we have left in my pocket before making a choice. I have enough for 2 main meals and drinks with just about enough left over for potential ice-cream later on in the town. But definitely not enough for starters. I usually like to get starters. I think chefs like making starters. Little appetising bursts of flavour to excite you before your main meal but unfortunately starters at Dubrakva are simply out of our budget range. I ask cute girlfriend if she wants a starter and she says no. This is good, we can afford a meal. But I can't help but feel a bit annoyed at the price given we could've gotten a large pizza for 2 elsewhere for the price of 1 main at Dubravka. Roll with it. YOLO.

The waiter approaches to take an order for our drinks. A bit more time for me to make my way through the novel sized menu. I felt a bit dehydrated so I opted for water. This also felt like the sensible option given the expensive prices for food. Cute girlfriend opted for blueberry juice. The waiter asked her again. She again said blueberry juice. He was confused and looked at her as if she was making up items that weren't on the menu. He had never heard of blueberry juice. To be honest, neither had I, and I was also confused as to why she had opted for blueberry juice but it was on the menu and she wanted to try something different. He began naming the juices that were available such as orange juice, pineapple juice, apple juice but didn't believe that blueberry was an option. Cute girlfriend then turns to the menu for evidence and shows him the option for blueberry juice. He still looks confused but writes down the order. We were a little bit surprised but given the 8000 items on the menu, you can forgive the waiter for not knowing everything. He returned with the water and the blueberry juice apologising for his confusion.

I have finally decided on a main dish. I decide on the Veal medallions in chanterelle sauce whilst cute girlfriend opted for Fillet of pork with gorgonzola sauce. Googling of ""chanterelle"" and ""gorgonzola"" took place before confirming our order with our waiter. But the sauce aside, I was mainly just excited for the veal. I didn't really pay attention to anything else. The waiter took our orders and walked away. I was confused as to why the waiter didn't ask how I wanted my veal cooked but I had faith that it would be good.

Some bread arrived at the table. A lot of bread in fact. I started to wonder if the surcharge for the food was to account for the amount of bread you were given. But granted, the bread was good. I was victim to ""if you put food in front of me, I will eat it"". I ate a fair amount of bread before cute girlfriend stopped me. Then as we waited for our mains with a cold drink at hand, I had time to sit back and appreciate the restaurant's atmosphere. The outdoor setting in the middle of a crowded tourist filled area was surprisingly peaceful. With the sounds of some gentle live music playing in the background and slight breeze in hot Croatian weather sitting across from cute girlfriend in candlelight, everything was perfect. Maybe the food surcharge is fair for the location and the atmosphere that makes it impossible not to fall in love with this beautiful town.

The food arrives and to my surprise, my veal is served with brussels sprouts and vegetable fingers whilst cute girlfriend's pork fillet was served with potato croquettes and broccoli. I don't like brussels sprouts or vegetable fingers. I like broccoli. I didn't remember seeing brussels sprouts and vegetable fingers on the menu. But I wasn't going to let that bother me. I wanted the veal and I got the veal. Excited, I'm ready to tuck in. I cut a piece of my veal and take a bite. My face drops. It's completely overcooked and rubbery. I'm shocked. I start thinking to myself, have I had veal before? I definitely have and it's never been like this. Doubting myself, I turn to google. I search for pictures of veal steaks and see what I expect, pieces of veal cooked perfectly at medium rare. It's not inedible, just not anything enjoyable. Accompanied with 2 sides that I don't like, I'm starting to regret my meal. Cute girlfriend cuts a piece of her pork fillet and puts it on my plate. I try it and it's better than my veal (annoyingly) but it's still the same; overcooked and rubber. So between us the only appealing things on the table is the broccoli and what's left of the complimentary bread.

We try not to let the over-priced average food bother us too much as the setting and atmosphere was good, let's focus on the positives here. So we talked about what was nice about the restaurant ignoring the food. We agreed that the staff were very nice and attentive and the live background music was a nice touch. We decided to have see where the music was coming from to realise that the live music was actually coming from another restaurant/bar next door. The price of our meal is once again popping into my head; the surcharge we're paying no longer covers the music.

We make it through our mains, the brussels sprouts left behind as we sit back and review the meal. It then dawned on us that the vegetable fingers and the potato croquettes must've come from frozen packets surely. And if they came from frozen, how much of the rest of the menu was from frozen? Was the broccoli from frozen? The brussels sprouts? Quite possibly. Then we came to think, what about the veal and the pork fillets, is it all from frozen? Is that why they had to be cooked well-done with no other choice? Is this equivalent to a frozen ready meal? It might actually be so. With my inner Sherlock coming through, I came to think that with an average sized restaurant, how can they possibly offer about 10 pages worth of food on their menu? How can they possibly store that much variety? How big is their freezer?

We catch the attention of the waiter to ask for the bill and he nods and says he'll get it right away. As I sit there eating the remains of our ""free"" bread waiting for the bill, I start concluding my experience of Dubravka. Was it worth it? In short, the answer is no. Despite the amazing atmosphere, it's an atmosphere that you can experience for free by standing right next to restaurant's outdoor seating area. There you'll be able to experience the perfect view, light breeze and the relaxing music from the establishment next door. The only thing you won't get is very disappointing food, most probably from frozen on a candlelit table. 

The bill still hasn't arrived. We catch the attention of the waiter once again and he once again nods. We start thinking about whether or not we should go get some ice-cream in the town. Dessert at Dubravka was out of the question. With this in mind I do start to think, ice-cream anywhere would've been out of the question without the 10% discount that we were given so we must be thankful for that and although our waiter is struggling to juggle his tables to get us our bill, he was very nice and welcoming and so there was nothing really horrible about our experience. The bill still hasn't arrived so we catch the attention of another waiter who instantly gets our bill. Our original waiter notices and intercepts him to present us with our bill personally apologising that he's been a bit too busy. We're not fussed and politely pay the bill giving him the 10% voucher. He tells us to keep the voucher so we can use it next time and thanks us for our custom. That 10% voucher won't be used again.

As we get up to leave, I notice the live band playing next door as I stop by the entrance to take a quick peek at the menu. Cute girlfriend stops confused as to what I'm doing. I look and my suspicions are correct; I am my own worst enemy. Brussels sprouts and vegetable fingers were listed as sides to the veal but I didn't read the menu properly. I should've read the menu properly. I flashback to think how different my life may have been, how enjoyable my meal might've been, if I just learnt the importance of reading in school during GCSE English Lit.",,Jun 2017

Sigita R,null,null,3,1.0,3.0,3.0,null,"We went to this restaurant three times during our stay and would like to describe them all.

First visit was for my boyfriends birthday and I booked it online requesting to consider it was for birthday. They replied via e-mail and confirmed.
On a day - meal was pleasant, had lovely seat facing That game of thrones wall. After we had our food - nothing happened in regards to birthday so i had to ask waiter making this too obvious to my boyfriend if they could do something about it. Waiter was in doubt but then managed to get this Jazz band to play little birthday tune and bring a slice of cake.

Visit number two was very short as we were willing to have some breakfast in the morning. We were on the way to the beach so I was in biquini top and shorts and this waiter let us in leading to the terrace seat as suddenly another waitress behind me rudely asked if I had a shirt to put on top?? Well I had no shirt so that was what I said and so then another guy jumped into the scene screaming I could not be there in swim wear. This just gobsmacked me and we immediately left. Really ruined my mood for the rest of the day. Just seemed they were not organised in regards to their guest rules or whatever regulations or was that some sort of fashion policing as in the rest of old town where you might pay apparently up to 200 kuna in case you decide it is really hot and you wish to be without a top!

So third visit was quite nice as on morning before our flight we decided to try this bloody place again as they have quite nice breakfast offer and as this time I had a top on I was brave enough to go gain. although we asked for extra bread and had to wait for quite a while, also ask twice.",,Aug 2017

With its superb location in such a popular tourist zone, you would be forgiven for thinking that the pricing and quality would not match up to your expectations- however this is definitely not the case here.
I was treated to a superb Seafood Risotto, followed by the Fried Squid - both of which were heavenly and clearly made with the freshest ingredients. My wife had Sea Bass, which was perfectly cooked in a simple but effective way.
Unfortunately there weren't any tables available next to the wall overlooking the bay, but there was still a very good view of the floodlit castle/ city walls from most of the tables.Service was excellently provided by our waiter.
The only negative, was a reluctance to provide a jug of table water to go with our drinks - everyone knows that the water here is safe to drink, so a little poor that only the expensive bottled stuff is an option.",,Jul 2017

We visited it once or even twice a day because it is so convenient. The food is satisfactory there. Now we become a frequent customer of this restaurant in these 3 days.
Then we talked about the food. I strongly recommend the breakfast 3, that is, eggs with cheese and hams. The ham they used is good, not the one used in Hong Kong. Also the breakfast 4, that is, omelette with fruits. The omelette is tasty. 
There are 3 types of bread. The normal white bread, the wheat bread and the sweet bread. There are different jams, nutella and honey the serve with the bread. We like to use honey to serve the tea and coffee. The taste is great and it is good for the stomach.
The dinner is good, too. Strong recommend the lamb with harsh brown.

So, great views of the city walls and the bay, and it's very accessible when you arrive in town. On the plus side the service and presentation were good.

But, and a big but, although you expect high prices in Croatia these days and in Dubrovnik in particular (the cruise ships line up daily to dock just down the road and discharge their load), that is no reason to then serve your hapless customers barely warm coffee, watered down orange juice, and a sheet of rubbery cheese lying flaccidly on two forlorn fried eggs for breakfast. No sir, not at these prices.

To be honest, I'd probably avoid if you don't want to feel ripped off for the rest of the day.

The service continued being spectacular with our multi-lingual waitress who we could hearing joking with guests in a multitude of languages. 

Whilst the service and views (and drinks) were absolutely spot on; the food wasn't our favourite. I opted for a traditional beef stake with boiled potatoes and found it a little bland for my liking, whilst the wife's pork was also a little 'without'.

We were quickly attended to by the waitstaff and placed our drink order. When the drinks arrived, 1 person in our party did not receive their drink and this wasn't noticed by the waitstaff. Several minutes later we brought this to their attention and the drink arrived. 

The same occurred with our meals. Meal orders were taken when our meals arrived, one meal was missing. Timing was terribly off!

My husband and I ordered a bottle of sparkling wine. Our glasses were left unfilled for sometime so I filled them myself. The maitre d' came over and made a joke about me filling my own glass and the restaurant hiring waiters. Ha ha! Our glasses remained unfilled for the rest of the night. 

While the meals we ordered were well prepared, for the most part, the lack of attention to orders, poor timing of meals, and glasses left unfilled cause me to reduce the rating of Debravka.

Ashley H,"Bristol, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"We were looking for somewhere to eat in the Old Town and this was recommended by our Rep, along with the Restaurant opposite.
Once we worked out where it was situated, I was a little dubious about it, presuming it was a bit of a tourist trap as it is right by the entrance to the old town where all the the cruise ship buses pick up and therefore crowded with people.
We chose the Dubravka a bit by default as it was the cheaper of the 2 options that our Rep had mentioned, and the other one had tableclothes that were far too white and waiters that were far too smart ( not that the Debravka guys were'nt!)
And I am so pleased we choose it- we ended up eating here twice, returning here for our last night in Dubrovnik as this was our favourite place to eat during our 10 days in the Dubrovnik area.
The food was lovely, the service on both nights was fantastic, really attentive without being overbearing. The house red wine was the best we had anywhere on our hols and the view and position of the place were amazing, topped off with the sight of a huge owl sitting on the roof of the restaurant opposite on the look out for his dinner.
I can't recommend the Dubravka enough, made even better the second time by a discount card giving us 10% off.

We were invited in as soon as we approached the restaurant. It looked very nice, it had a nice view and we settled down without anticipating the very good wine we were about to be served accompanied by shrimps in a divine sauce with garlic and black pasta.

The food was excellent and so was the service. And not a lot to complain about the food either.

The menu has a little bit of everything and everything seemed delicious. Don't be put off by the fact that the menu refers to some dishes as starters (warm & cold). They are sizeable portions and enough as a lunch main course at least.

Probably not the cheapest of places but with mains, desserts and beer, wine plus soft drinks for 3 people 750 kn (100€) didn't seem that bad.

With the sun shining on the terrace and a view to the sea and the city walls, I was very happy with our choice.

Considering the location the food is very affordable, with different options from pizza and pasta to fish and meat dishes, including several choices for vegetarians. I ordered the grilled squid with boiled vegetables and potato. Though this sounds bland the natural sweetness and freshness of the squid carried the plate and proved an enjoyable meal. The greek salad was rich, filling and delicious too. 

There's not much more to say except the food was delicious, staff pleasant, and the view extraordinary. This place scores extra points because unlike most places inside of the walls, they don't have staff stood outside trying to drag you inside.

After the main dishes, we ordered a walnuts pancake. We did not like it. The walnuts tasted non-baked. We should just order a chocolate one.
All the little dissatisfied points couldn't ruin the great view here. If you come to this restaurant you must sit outside so that you could enjoy the old town view.

We used this venue on further occasions as the food was so good. Each time my husband couldn't resist the soup or cake. We also tried the pasta,salmon and chicken. All were good sized portions. On our last visit it was too chilly to sit in the courtyard so sat on an enclosed veranda over looking the city walls. As returning customers the staff gave us a 10% discount. Most of the chairs have blankets if you should feel cold and patio fires trained on the tables. A really lovely restaurant which gave us some happy memories of our stay",,Mar 2017

We were on a cruise ship excursion and after a morning full of touring Old Town Dubrovnik, we had about an hour and a half of free time before meeting up to go back to our cruise ship. We needed to ""refuel"" and it was close to our meeting point so we said what the heck and got a table. What a good choice it was, a beautiful location, on a beautiful afternoon in Dubrovnik. 

Being it was just two of us we ordered a margherita pizza (a perfect size for two people) and a couple cocktails (yeah we needed a second wind in that way as well). Frankly I was so hungry at this point I would have been happy to have something to eat at the Croatian equivalent of a hot dog stand. But I was so happy we chose this restaurant. 

The service was great, the hostess and our waiter were very welcoming and friendly. It was so relaxing, I felt like I could have stayed there for hours, not to mention our pizza and cocktails were excellent. If I wasn't so hungry (and had the rest of the afternoon to spend there) I would have looked at the menu more and probably ordered multiple items, that's how good that pizza was, therefore I can only imagine that their other meals are just as good. 

If you're visiting Dubrovnik, you should really check out this restaurant. If I'm EVER back there (I hope so, one day) and this restaurant is still there (I hope that is so also) I would definitely go back.",,Sep 2016

We are not fans of Game of Thrones, but upon Googling it, we saw we were next to where they filmed some scenes. 
We had starters. Tomato n mozzarella and ceviche with fish and capers. Very good.
Mains were a pasta dish, lamb chops and again, pretty good. My daughter wanted a crepe for dessert. The crepe on their menu was without strawberries and we asked for some. The waiter paused for a while before telling us he would see what he can do. He managed to pull off this incredible feat somehow and strawberries were produced. 
Overall, this restaurant is not amazing in any way, but it's competent and satisfactory.
I would mention the lack of enthusiasm and politeness of the staff, but this is something we encountered at every restaurant in Croatia except for one. They don't make you feel particularly welcome like the Greeks do, for example. If I'd wanted to be served by people who don't make you feel like royalty or don't make much of an effort, I could have gone to a restaurant at home in England.

Dubravka Restaurant doesn't serve breakfast after noon, so we didn't stay. Later in the week we decided to have dinner here, after perusing the menu and finding several interesting possibilities.

We can't dine where there's smoking, so we were escorted to the front patio overlooking the sea and provided with a personal heater and blankets to keep us warm. We were already very impressed with the wonderful personalized service, and the quaint cozy ambiance. Views are spectacular, especially if you happen to catch sunset.

We started with a glass of wine and a coffee with Baileys. Creamed vegetable soup arrived not long after our drinks, and it was excellent. 

Hubby ordered the lasagne, after ascertaining that the meat was 100% beef, and I ordered turkey steak in mushroom sauce with penne pasta. The food was fantastic, well prepared, good quality, and presented beautifully. Our server checked on us regularly, as did the manager to ensure that we were comfortable and our meal was as expected.

Our total bill for drinks, soup, and two entrees was 310 kunas, but out of the blue the restaurant reduced our bill by 10% - off season discount, I believe the server mentioned. We spent a total of $40 USD plus tip.

The staff began to bring out heat lamps for all the diners and each one was offered a red rug if they were cold, it was about 19 degrees, my wife and I had shorts on and t-shirts!!!

We sat where we could see both the Pile Gate and the ocean leading out to Fort Bokar and Fort Lovrijenac.

My seafood salad was the BEST I have ever had with every bite including lots of octopus, capers, onions and other seafood morsels in a delightful dressing. I should have ordered two!

We also had lasagna bolognese (amazing flavour and texture) and tagliatelle with seafood (I could've sworn I was in pasta heaven!). The first and subsequent tastes were so fantastic, we both forgot to sprinkle freshly grated Parmesan onto our dinners. There was NO room for dessert.

We didn't get a seat right by the sea wall, but this didn't bother us. 

The menu is quite big, lots of options, but they are broken down into sub-sections (ie pizza, seafood, etc). I selected beef carpaccio starter and lamb fillet main in chanterelle mushroom sauce, which I enjoyed and were tasty, however, my husband selected the marinated salmon starter, and mussels main and thought they were both average. (I don't know if this was due to my selections being slightly more expensive) The portion of mussels was generous, but the mussels themselves were small. We also shared a ""Dubravka cake"" for dessert which was nice.

What I liked: The outdoor seating, the view, the relatively typical Dalmatian menu, featuring fairly decent seafood options. Quick and efficient service. For a place that busy, food quality was above average while prices remained reasonable.

What to watch for/could be improved: This is a very busy place and as great as the setting is, I would not say that this is a ""relaxing"" place, especially during the busiest part of tourist season.

Non backpacker,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"Just returned from an evening meal at Dubravka and it was fabulous! 

We pre-booked by emailing asking for a table by the water edge on the terrace - well worth planning ahead! 

Only downside of the whole evening was that it rained meaning some neighbouring diners had to be moved to avoid getting wet - the waiters dealt with this very well and made sure everyone still enjoyed their evening.

The live music was great - we particularly liked the game of thrones theme tune! 

The food was great - we had the seafood risotto starter as a main - it was a very generous portion that we didn't finish! We also had the the feta salad which was very creamy and well prepared. 

Though the rain didn't spoil our evening at all - The waiter took 30% off the bill. We followed this with a large tip which was throughly deserved. 

We're hoping to back back at least once before we leave Dubrovnik.

The tables were not too close togethere there like restaurants inside the old town, so it felt really relaxed .
The views are spectacular but most of all the food is worth waiting for if you have to wait for a table .
We booked ahead via our hotel and had a dream of a table. 
The Gnocchhi was amazing for a starter. 
If you go book a table in the second row , you have brill views but are not to close to the edge nor the pigeons !
Don't book the table on the far right , that is a table for two as after the restaurant ends there's a general area and loads of tourists appears to take their selfie shot and we observed that groups of selfie takers were getting close to the people sitting at this table. 
Also note the prawn risotto on the starter is a bit prawn limited , so you may want to consider another option . Finally the house Croatian wine ( white) is really good in case you feel like a glass or two !

Overall a great restaurant just outside Pile Gate .
Really enjoyed it .

adambutterworth,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"We spent the evening in Dubrovnik as we stayed in Cavtat which is 6 miles away. After looking around a couple of restaurants we decided to eat in Dubravka after reading other TripAdvisor reviews. We weren't disappointed.

When we arrived, we were warned by the server that they was a possibility of rain as they only had tables available outside. She let us know that it may not come, but she didn't want to let it ruin our meal. We decided to take the risk and luckily it was nothing more than a couple of droplets of rain - not even a light shower.

I'm a big foodie and particularly enjoy seafood. I asked our server what he recommended rather than looking through the menu. He suggested I try the Kozice Dubrovački (Shrimp Dubrovnik) as in his opinion it was the best thing on the menu. It was delicious! If you're a fan of eating with a knife and fork, don't order this as you've got to de-shell and remove the heads of the shrimp yourself. For everyone else - try it, it's delicious!

During the meal, there was a cellist and pianist playing jazz arrangements of well known popular songs. I've never heard a version of Eiffel 65's 'Blue (Da Ba Dee)' quite like it! It was awesome! Other music included Rihanna, Katy Perry, Abba and theme tunes to films and TV shows. All equally well arranged.

With my meal I had an Espresso Martini which was very good. The total bill 2 Gin & Tonics, an Espresso Martini, a Sprite and the Kozice Dubrovački (for 1 person) came to 372kn so not bad considering the quality of the food, the service, live music and setting which was beautiful.",,Aug 2016

We were given a table with a great view and the couple playing piano and violin were right next to us. A memorable evening.,,Jul 2016

Island384,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,null,null,null,null,"We got off the bus and looked at the menu as we admired the view where this restaurant was. Whilst looking we were offered 10% off. We were not disappointed. We were given a lovely table overlooking the walls and sea near to where the music was going to be all perfectly explained. We started with the mixed fish salad which was beautiful - swordfish carpaccio, prawns and anchovies and tasted delicious! All presented with rocket and sauce. Next I had tuna which was unbelievably beautiful and succulent served with salad, grilled tomatoes and slices of roast potatoes. My partner had trout with almonds which again was delicious served with a head of broccoli and rice. The portions were large and we could eat no more. The bill came to about 499 kuna - about £50 for the two of us with the 10% off including a beer for both of us and one glass of wine. We were expecting to pay more in Dubrovnik to what we had paid on the islands. I'm not sure why I'm only giving 4* - probably nitpicking but the presentation of the menu does not do this restaurant justice- it looks amateur but the food is impeccable not touristy as you may expect on first views.",,Jul 2016

Terrific service - we were warmly greeted, told how many tables were available outside (which was our preference), and on the occasion that more than one table was available, we were allowed to pick which one we desired. 2. The food! I loved the risotto and the local red wine. 3. The view. If you sit on the large terrace, you'll be able to see both the Adriatic and the city walls.

Sadly, Dubravka 1836 offers a very different experience. The service was extremely slow, which was painful on a 92 degree day (it took 20 minutes to just get water!). When my meal came, my sunny side up eggs were not cooked and had been covered in slices of cheese (gross). My wife's pizza was similarly over cheesed and almost soupy.

We were welcomed by one very friendly and kind waitress who had placed us at one of the best tables in the whole restaurant.

My girlfriend had roasted salmon with vegetables and I had some beefsteak with cheese and mushrooms. Both of the meals were very tasty. At the end we took some ice cream cup.
The whole impression of the meal was very good, but it became even better after we were given a little discount on the bill due to the fact we are Croatians.

A plus for this restaurant is its location. It is probably the first restaurant you would see as it is only beside Pile Gate. Another plus is its view. There are seats where you can have the view of the Adriatic Sea. It was during the busy lunch hours when we got there so we got to seat a bit far away from the sea view but we quite enjoyed the view of the Walls of Dubrovnik (and I enjoyed being in the shade as I have sensitive skin and burn darn easily haha).

Three of my friends ordered their seafood platter which they truly enjoyed. My sister got their pasta and I ordered their grilled salmon with dill sauce served with veggies. The food is great, it is something we'd rarely have in Dublin. We were served complimentary bread that kept our ""hangriness"" at bay.

The service of the staff was amazing. They were friendly not to us but to all their customers. They offered us a card that we can use the next time we eat there and/or their sister restaurant ""Restaurant Panorama"" and get a 10% discount.

For my first visit on this trip I had the sea bass, which was very good, as usual. For dessert I had chocolate pancakes, which have a LOT of chocolate in them! I went back again 5 nights later and the waitress remembered me. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not, bearing in mind the amount of customers they serve, but it's nice to know that you're not just a faceless customer. On this second visit I had the beefsteak in sauce. Again, a very good meal. I had the pancakes again but this time asked for less chocolate, which was much better. 

It is a good mid-range restaurant, and excellent value for money, especially compared to eating out in the UK. For beefsteak, pancakes and 2 glasses of house white wine I paid about £23. Not bad!

The service was first class; the staff were very attentive without been over bearing and the service was very prompt. Most importantly once we had finished our meal we were left to enjoy our remaining wine in the peace and quiet. The table was ours for the night. 

One the first night I had the seafood risotto which was brilliant and something I would highly recommend. On the second night we had mussels to start which were served in an excellent tomato based sauce (although the mussels themselves were a bit small) and for main I had the grill prawns, which were good but felt expensive for 4 prawns and some rice. Overall the food was good, and very good compared to what I had elsewhere (nothing blew my mind away on the whole trip really). 

What I must recommend is the drinks. We had the house red on both nights and it was thoroughly enjoyable and amazing value! I also had an expresso martini and it was perfection! 

All in in all I would recommend anyone who costs Dubrovnik visits this restaurant.",,Mar 2016

We had the local mussel speciality and the local prawn speciality. We didn't use cutlery (although it was provided if we wanted it) which is the way it is done by the locals apparently and I have to say getting saucy, messy and sated was a lot of fun. Our waiter Roberto was fantastic. He not only brought us wet wipes he opened the packets for us as he realized how tricky it would have been otherwise. When he saw the mess we'd made of the table cloth he beamed and said we were doing it right! I was pleased I didn't have to be embarrassed for making a mess and really enjoying my lunch. 

We got to watch the boats sail by and tourists walking the walls.

The waiters were very attentive & brought out blankets to keep us warm. Would definitely return.",,Sep 2015
Tin N,"Hvar, Croatia",Croatia,4,5.0,3.0,4.0,null,"The restaurant location is amazing, especially if you have a table on the terrace overlooking the city walls and a cove in front, close to the town centre and still far enough from the loud streets. The food was very good from the starters to a desert. However, the service wasn't that great, they were or rushing around the resto or were chatting in a corner. It was a bit annoying to call them 5 times just to ask for an extra glass, ashtray, etc, but we don't mind it as someone do. at the end of the day, it was a nice experience.",,Sep 2015
Canuckdaturk,"Toronto, Canada",Canada,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,null,"The restaurant is very conveniently located, next to the old town west gate. It has a beautiful view. Like most of the restaurants, it has mostly Italian food. The portions are small. I had spaghetti with Adriatic prawns, and it didn't have much taste to it. My wife had spaghetti with chicken, and she thought it was decent. Our waiter, his name was Hvavoce (or similar), was probably one of the worst waiters I have ever encountered. When he came to take our order, my wife asked his recommendation between two items. He said ""I don't know"", and rolled his eyes and sighed. I can understand this to a point. I also had a question to him, and asked how big the Turkey steak was, since it was not mentioned in the menu. He said ""I don't know"". Now, I don't think that should be the answer. I chose the spaghetti. I do not recommend this restaurant at all, there are plenty of options in the area.",,Sep 2015
FingersCrossed5,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,3,null,null,null,null,"We had two meals here. The first consisted of the American and Italian and chocolate crossiants. All very good. Waiters attentive and it seemed clean. The next day we had lunch which on both counts was a let down. We had the mixed fish and tuna salad. All of which was fishy (in a not so fresh kind of way), dry and overlooked. Certainly nothing to write home about and probably to be avoided.",,Sep 2015
Steierc,"Bristol, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,2,null,null,null,null,"Myself and my girlfriend decided to eat in here after being recommended by friends. We arrived and shown to our seat and were then left to wait 15 minutes before being shown a menu, another 15 minutes passed before we were able to place our order. Once orders were placed drinks arrived promptly, and food shortly after, mine a pizza and the Girlfriends a pasta & fish dish, hers was lovely, mine not so, soggy and cold in the middle. Frankly had better pizzas from Take-Away restaurants. We then had to wait for over 20 minutes go get the attention of a member of staff ( who seem to pay more attention to serving larger groups ) to ask for the bill. All in all a disappointing experience.",,Sep 2015

mobiletoybox,"Glenrothes, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,null,null,null,null,Went here twice during our stay in dubrovnik. The first time was absolutely flawless and the food was delicious. Thoroughly enjoyed everything and the views from where we sat were great. Decided to eat there again on our last day and was a bit disappointed. My friend's order wasn't what she'd expected (she'd misread the menu) but she ate half of it anyway as she didn't want to wait. Caught the staff making fun of her for this and those same staff then didn't collect our plates or bring us our ordered water or our bill at the end. We had to ask for things multiple times. I'd have scored a lot lower if this had been the only day we'd gone but the first day was so flawless I can't bring myself to mark lower!,,Sep 2015

Sadly we only noticed after we'd left. Wouldnt recommend.",,Sep 2015

charly792014,"Paris, France",France,3,null,null,null,null,We came at this restaurant based on the comments we saw on TA. All is about the terrasse but the food is good but not fantastic and quite expensive even if you're in Dubrovnik. And it is very close to the Pile Gate which means a lot of traffic noise. Might be a good stop for a quick lunch but not the best place for a dinner in Dubrvnik.,,Sep 2015

We are able to be seated at a table with good views of the walls and the sea. We found the food to be more than acceptable -- the octopus salad was deemed of particular high quality. The tiger prawns Dubrovnik were also very good.

Our waiter, Marijo, was a good deal of fun and helpful for us to better understand the city.",,Sep 2015
jeannie2nyc,"South Orange, New Jersey",USA,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,null,"We were looking for a cool place to have a long, leisurely lunch, and Dubravka fit the bill perfectly. It was our last day in Dubrovnik, but it was too hot to do a lot of sightseeing. We were attracted to Dubravka because it had large fans with misters, plus the bonus of a view of the wall. But it turned out that the food and service were quite good, and we enjoyed a nice long lunch there. Our large group had a variety of dishes, including salads and pizza, and all were good, particularly the pizza. The highlight, however, was the dessert. Large (huge) bowls of ice cream with the works. My daughter had a banana split that was served in a bowl shaped like a gondola. All the other patrons looked on with envy. Considering its location near the Pile Gate, which could mean tourist trap, it was quite good. I'd go back again.",,Aug 2015

James H,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,null,"Initially just had a coffee and (lots) of water after ""walking the walls"" and thought a nice place for dinner. Returned a couple of days later and the, while we couldn't get a table by the wall we were seated a few tables away which was fine. We ordered starters, some pasta dishes and a local red wine. Servers were friendly and efficient with the courses arriving without having to wait too long, or being rushed. When we ordered coffee the waiter asked if we would like to move to a table by the wall so we could enjoy the views - a nice touch.
Definitely one of the better experiences and meals we enjoyed during our time in Dubrovnik.",,Sep 2015
Bruce W,"Toronto, Canada",Canada,4,5.0,2.0,5.0,null,Lovely restaurant just outside the walls of the Old City. Food was great - my wife had John Dory and I had whole trout. Delicious. View was amazing as we lucked into a table right on the water despite a same day booking. Service wasn't great hence the four stars - we felt a bit abandoned at our table which was out of keeping with the food and ambience.,,Sep 2015
