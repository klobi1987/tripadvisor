## 1️⃣ SITUATION

**Context:**
- 4 premium fine dining restaurants in Dubrovnik
- Combined 11,300+ TripAdvisor reviews
- Strong brand equity but fragmented digital presence
- Multiple source markets with varying penetration levels

**Current State:**
- ✅ Strong organic presence: TripAdvisor (11,300+ reviews)
- 🟡 Emerging presence: Dianping China (566 reviews - 3 of 4 restaurants)
- ❓ Unknown: Presence in other key markets (Japan, Korea, USA, etc.)
- ❌ Limited: Structured digital advertising strategy

---

## 2️⃣ COMPLICATION

**Key Challenges:**
1. **Market Fragmentation** - Each source market uses different platforms
2. **Opportunity Cost** - Missing markets = lost revenue potential
3. **Competition** - Competitors may already dominate certain platforms
4. **Resource Allocation** - Limited budget requires prioritization
5. **Cultural Nuance** - Each market requires customized approach

**The Critical Question:**
> "Where should we invest our digital marketing resources to maximize ROI from international tourists?"

---

## 3️⃣ KEY QUESTION (To Answer for Gazda)

**Primary Question:**
"In which countries and on which platforms should we advertise to capture the highest-value tourists for our restaurants?"

**Sub-Questions:**
1. Where are we currently mentioned online (by country/platform)?
2. Which markets have the highest spending potential?
3. What are the gaps in our current digital presence?
4. What are competitors doing that we're not?
5. What's the estimated ROI for each market opportunity?

---

## 4️⃣ HYPOTHESIS (Initial Answer)

**Our Hypothesis:**
"By focusing on 5 key markets (USA, China, Japan, UK, Germany) across 8 strategic platforms, we can increase high-value tourist capture by 40% with an estimated €500K-€2M additional annual revenue."

**Confidence Level:** Medium-High (requires validation through research)
