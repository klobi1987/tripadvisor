Anonymous,null,null,2,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,We went last evening 5.30 pm. Beautiful views of the Old Town and surrounds. Except for the huge crane blocking the view. Our 5 star hotel booked a seat on the front row for us. We walked up stairs for the restaurant as instructed by the uber driver. The young woman on front desk told us to go out the door and walk down the stairs. No other help or direction. We stumbled on next level and the woman there checked our reservation and took us down the hill to the lowest deck where the bar was. My wife noticed our table reserved was no 42 but we were taken to no 22. Why? We were dressed well and baby boomers. We got money. So got a bad table. Waiter was rushed and totally disinterested in us. The food was lamb cutlets (waiter argued with us that it was lamb chops) and I had risotto. 5-6 mouthfuls. Price was really large. A total rip off. But we saw a sunset,,Oct 2025

Tony was our server and was so thoughtful. He made sure our heat lamp was in the right place and even brought us a second one when he noticed we were cold. A reservation cancelled and he also moved us to a better table to enjoy our drinks! This whole experience is an absolute must if you’re in Dubrovnik. Thank again, Tony!",,Oct 2025

Glad we did as we were able to book a front row table on a day where the weather was lovely, luckily we did not leave it till later as the weather changed at the end of our break. 
Walk ins were being taken while we were there but in between bookings so at a reduced time allocation at the table but we wanted to take our time and enjoy the experience.
Our waiter was very friendly, very knowledgeable of the menu and was able to suggest alternatives to our original choice which meant we could enjoy more items off the menu. 
We had a vegetable risotto to start, beef steak main, sweets & drinks at a reasonable price €140 for two. The beef was cooked to perfection. 
All of the above was complimented by the amazing location looking over the old town. 
Would highly recommend and will return.",,Oct 2025

Anyway, we visited just before noon mid-week without a booking and managed to get a front-row table. 
Being able to sit and enjoy the view was worth it.

That said, we ordered light, a steak sandwich along with the cream cake.
The steak sandwich was surprisingly good (and contrary to some other reviews, had plenty of steak). The cake was well .. cake.

Overall, if you can't make a booking online, give it a try, you might be able to walk in. Don't expect too much in terms of food and just take in the view.",,Oct 2025

Cayman Mike,"Annapolis, Maryland",USA,5,null,null,null,null,We had booked a reservation 6 months ago and were guaranteed a first row outside seat overlooking iconic Dubrovnik. The weather did not cooperate and the evening of our reservation we had gale force winds. All people were forced inside which provided a great challenge the staff. We are easy-going and realized that they were trying to please as many people as they could under difficult circumstances. All reservations had to be accommodated inside a tiny space. We were originally seated in a space in the back of the restaurant right near the drafty door. We said that was fine as we new they were challenged. The mentioned that if a window seat became available we would be moved. The server immediately brought 2 complimentary glasses of champagne to our table. Just after that a table became available up front and we were moved. At the end of our meal we were provided with 10% discount. My point is that the staff functioned under a lot of stress and still provided great service and discounts not really necessary. That is the sign of professionally run restaurant. The food you ask??? It was superb. I had pasta and seafood as a starter and a huge piece of salmon. My wife had tempura and everything was wonderful.,,Oct 2025

It clouded up a bit during our stay, so got a bit chilly, do consider a jacket if going later in the year. We walked up the mountain, which required a sturdy shoe and good fitness, but the toilets are clean and spacious to freshen up and change before your meal.

Karen Hardman,"Manchester, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"We decided to go up to Panorama - mainly for the sunset views. We didn't use the cable car as it was a really hot night and didn't fancy being in a hot box with plenty of other people so we took a taxi - door to door (hotel door) for about the same price as the cable car - and it was air conditioned!
We got to the restaurant and was told that they didn't have any outside tables unless we wanted to wait for a couple of hours - no thanks - but offered us a table inside. 
Got taken to our table (first table), hubby went to take some pictures and I moved our table (second table - away from the plants), hubby came back and we were just having drinks waiting for our food and the lovely young lady came over to us and offered us a table by the window (third table) which we took and want disappointed. 
Food arrived - I had veal risotto, and the hubby had steak - all delicious 😋 

I had tried to book this restaurant prior to coming on holiday, but couldn't get in, so I was pleased we did the walk-in.

Rob P,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,3,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,"Lovely setting, it's really hard not to love where the restaurant is given the spectacular views from pretty much every seat.

We went as a family of 5 and had to wait for a table, and once sat we had another wait for service which was surprising given there didn't seem to be a shortage of staff.

Staff were professional rather than welcoming or friendly, drinks good and food was okay but not great. Disappointing for me was the attitude I received when I asked for a naked burger (no bun) when they said it wasn't possible. 

Given a 3 rating due to the staff attitude really. Although the food wasn't as good as other restaurants in the town at the bottom of the hill, the views made up for it.",,Jul 2025

My family and I had an incredible dining experience. From the moment we arrived for our reservation, the staff was exceptionally accommodating, moving us to a front-row table with an unforgettable view of Dubrovnik's Old Town and Lapad.
The ambiance was beautiful, but the true highlight was our waiter, Martin Galic. He was an expert on both the food and drink menus, offering fantastic recommendations throughout our lunch. We started with a delicious Italian meat and cheese charcuterie board, perfectly paired with refreshing Aperol Spritzes. For dessert, we shared a wonderful apple pie, and Martin helped us end the meal with a classic Sljivovica.

Shannon C,null,null,5,null,null,null,null,"We couldn’t have been happier about the food, the view and the service. We ordered “a lot of food” as the waiter said but didn’t regret a single bite of it. We ordered our drinks, Deep Blue cocktail and a cider, there was no rush in ordering food as at one stage we couldn’t make our minds up, so we got recommendations from the waiter, and then we still couldn’t make up our minds as everything sounded amazing!

 We got the beef carpaccio and the Dalmatian trilogy to start with focaccia for the table. To say we were speechless would be an understatement, order them both if you’re unsure as you won’t be disappointed in the slightest ! 

Then for the mains we got the lamb chops, the beef steak, and the prawns. We couldn’t choose and we’re glad we didn’t leave anything behind. The steak was like butter, superb ! The lamb was so stunning in looks and taste. The prawns were one of the tastiest dishes we’ve had while on holidays (and at home) 

The service was exquisite couldn’t complain on any part of the meal, we had two hours of absolute bliss with the stunning views, service and food. Definitely pre book your table as it does get extremely busy around sunset.

Completely forgot to get a picture of the prawns as we were so busy eating the dish but don’t let it deter you as I promise it’s amazing, so worth it !",,Jul 2025
Lory,"Zurich, Switzerland",Switzerland,5,null,null,null,null,"Those who are willing to spend a little more will be rewarded with an unforgettable experience in the Panorama. The location on Mount Srđ is spectacular – the view over Dubrovnik and the Adriatic Sea is simply breathtaking and worth the cable car ride alone. You can also go there by taxi, the cost is similar for 2 people. 

The food? Excellent. Creatively prepared, tastefully to the point and beautifully arranged. Especially the fish dishes and local specialties have inspired us. The Service was attentive, friendly and professional – without being intrusive.

Yes, the prices are upscale – but absolutely justified given the quality, location and overall atmosphere. For a special dinner in Dubrovnik, the Panorama is the address.

Recommendation: Make sure to book in advance and arrive in time for sunset – the view is unique.",,Jul 2025

misko2016,"Toronto, Canada",Canada,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,"We had lunch at front row. Managed to find reservation the night before (bunch of tables became available late in the evening). Was hoping for a dinner reservation but when I tried 2-3 months before there was no availability so I would advise booking much sooner for front row dinner during peak season (June/August, possibly September). 
The welcome by the two hostesses was warm and friendly and we had the most incredible view from our table.

My husband had a burger which was good and I ordered squid with rice dish that ended up being Indian/Croatian fusion dish that tasted amazing and, if I were I home back in Toronto, I would have just loved. My suggestion would be to discuss with the waiter if one wants a more traditional dish because I had no idea that I was getting a fusion dish based on the description. I still really enjoyed my fusion dish and it was superbly made. 

I ordered a cocktail with Rosemary and it was the best cocktail on this trip but 90% of it was ice. When I jokingly mentioned to the waiter that it is 90% ice as o was ordering the second one (in Croatian, my native tongue) he told me that this is just how all cocktails everywhere were made. It felt needlessly defensive (I wasn’t asking for anything extra) and took away from the good service we got initially. 
Overall a great experience and I would highly recommend it.",,Jul 2025

Our server, Martin, was exceptional — accommodating, energetic, and full of great food recommendations. He also shared some interesting insights about Dubrovnik, which made us feel right at home. Highly recommend requesting him when at this restaurant.

We started with refreshing mojitos that were perfectly balanced — not too sweet. For appetizers, we had the beef carpaccio and the orecchiette, both of which were delicious. For our main course, we shared the beef steak and chicken dish. Everything was so flavorful, we ended up taking the leftovers home.

I asked her politely to move her table back and she refused saying she wanted the better angle.
The waiters did nothing about it as I think they wanted to avoid any hastle.

For the dishes I took the gnocchi pepepe e caccio. The sauce was delicious, I don’t know if it was normally or just a cooking error but the gnocchi were “creamy” in it. I still finished my dish.

We got on the cable car at 915, had a lovely ride up then admired the views and went into the fortress museum which gave a great deal of information, maps, weaponry from the 1991 invasion. On the top of the fortress is a spectacular, unobstructed view of Dubrovnik. Then we went to our 1130 reservation at Panorama where we had a first row table staring straight down at old town, the benefit of making a reservation months in advance. The reservation also gives you 2 hours and 15 minutes at your table and we used all of them. 
The food is pricey but given the location was worth it. Also we dined at one of the sister restaurants the night before (Dubravka 1836) and got a coupon for 10% off our entire Panorama bill. A very lucky coincidence. We enjoyed the variety of our lunch from steak sandwiches to salads. They had gluten free buratta and gluten free octopus carpaccio appetizers. The shrimp risotto was gluten free as was the carob cake. All delicious. Martin was a great server and very helpful on the gluten free navigation. He also took great pics.

Once at the top, we were rewarded not only with a breathtaking view, but also with a really excellent cocktail. Yes, the prices are slightly higher – but honestly: Up here you pay for the whole package of service, quality and postcard view. And it's absolutely worth it.

The staff were friendly and in good spirits (perhaps they also secretly admired our sweaty glow after the climb). The atmosphere is relaxed, the panorama is fantastic – it couldn’t be better.

Down we went again on foot with a slightly tipsy grin.

The food, however, is another story. It's extremely expensive (and I have no issue with paying high prices for exquisite food), and there is limited choice for vegans or veggies.

From the cocktails while we waited for our table, to the warm blankets that were offered when the wind was blowing, to our waiter actually climbing over the divider to rescue my husband's sunglasses that had blown off.

We were only there for lunch, 3 of the 4 of us had the chicken burger and one of us had the steak sandwich. Finding the steak in the steak sandwich was difficult and I don't quite know how to describe the chicken burgers. It seemed to be a gray colour and maybe the odd fleck of white chicken.

The food is delicious - we had a couple of salads and they were superb.

Special mention to the service here though - there was a small mix up with our order, and the waiter and manager could not have been more polite and helpful. We have dined at a number of Michelin starred restaurants across Europe, and the service here stands up against any of them.

stephylynch,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Found this place recommended a lot on tiktok and booked a few weeks in advance as reccomended for a prime front row seat / table outside. The catch which I think could sway people either way is the cost of the cable cart (€27 euro return) to access the restaurant but honestly completely worth it. It has started to rain as we were waiting for the cable car so we were worried our outside table and view would be for nothing, but thankfully the rain stopped quickly. We'd booked for 3.30pm but because of the rain there was a bit of a wait as the restaurant can't cater to as many inside as it does outside, the waiter and manager was very nice and helpful, offered us a drink while we wait and a seat whilst they prepare our outside table which had to be dried and cleaned due to the rain. We didn't wait long and the ambiance inside the restaurant is lovely with equally amazing views as it does outside, small inside but a window seat would be ideal if you don't fancy booking outside. It wasn't long before our table was ready and the sun was shining again, we ordered the steak sandwich with fries which the waiter reccomended, it was delicious food was lovely and very reasonable, the staff are lovely,attentivitve and inviting. No concerns or issues at all, you can walk around outside the restaraunt too and take in the views for as long as u like before heading back down, you can also buy a single for the cable car if you wish to walk back down. My advice would be to book a table for panorama in advance as there was a big queue for walk ins on this particular occasion.",,Apr 2025

Following a change of plans ( not or fault), we turned up without a booking for lunch, and were taken straight away to a table with a brilliant view. The restaurant wasn't rammed like it would be at summer time. 
We got an Uber up the mountain for about 10 euros each way.
The food was good. I had orrechiete and my husband had a chicken burger. We had a beer, two glasses of wine and a large bottle of water. We also got fries and a basket of bread. The bill was under 75 euros. I don't think this is at all bad for such an amazing view. The staff were excellent.

There was a line for people waiting to be seated without a reservation which seemed to be moving fairly quick again because of the table time limit, they just were not seated in front row tables.

But once we reached the top and saw the beautifully set up oudoor restaurant we couldnt resist ourselves. We quickly got the table we wanted. Btw if you want the sea view corner row sitting which is the best you get 1 hr time if u order just drinks. However if u select any other rows there is no time limit even if u r just there for a drink. The staff is wonderful. All the staff members were so charming cheerful and always ready to help.. we asked them to take around 10 pics and also at different spots and they obliged each time with a smile. We didnt order food but I got a few beers while wifey tried a couple of cocktails and she loved them.

RickDen,"Beaconsfield, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,"Here's the thing; when you have something special, you need to ensure you get the best you can for it, and this restaurant certainly does.

They must have one of the best veiws from any table I know of, and they know how to market it.

You have to book 3-6 months upfront for a table, and then you can choose where you want to sit. I wanted the front line off the front terrace, obviously the most popular, as it offers the best view down to the Old Town. Because of this, I could only get the lunch time slot, before 18:00. In a way, I'm glad of this, as the prices go from expensive to astronomical for the evening meal times.

We had a simple soup, and tuna salad, 2x drinks and this came to a tad under €60; bit steep really. Add into that the cable car tickets of €54, and it turned into an expensive meal.

In all you pay a premium to get there, a premium for the meal, but is it worth it - probably to say you've been there and seen that..

Chris Robey,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Today my partner and I travelled up towards the Panorama restaurant on the cable car to enjoy the beautiful views overlooking the old town, and shortly after doing so, I took a knee and popped the big question - 10 years being boyfriend and girlfriend and months of planning for this proposal… a lot weighed on this moment!

Now, the trip up and around the area where the restaurant is located is beautiful itself, but I wanted to make our special moment extra special by celebrating with a glass of fizz!

Upon arrival we were quickly seated to a table of 2 which allowed us to continue looking over the old town - the views really were stunning and we were so grateful to have been seated at such short notice.

Waiter Vedran came to our table to take a drinks order, and upon reaching our table he noticed the fuss that we were making about being newly engaged, and without hesitation, Vedran disappeared for a brief moment only to then reappear with 2 glasses of fizz, each with a strawberry in!

This was a complimentary celebratory drink provided by not just the restaurant, but by Vedran personally himself, and that very kind and thoughtful gesture went a long way.

2 glasses of champagne and a few purchased cocktails later, my fiancé (get me!) and I left the restaurant feeling amazing and like our special moment was made even more special.

It seems like a small thing to leave a review on, but sometimes the smallest gestures go the longest way, and taking that gesture into consideration aswell as looking at all the amazing meals, service and experience being provided to others, it was a no brainer to come on here and leave a 5 star review.

The light lunch menu finished at 6pm . There is Burgers and mains starting at about 21 euro. So we had the aka carte. There is nothing on it kid friendly. My 2 children had chips each and my self and my HB had a steak and a chicken main. The steak was 47 euro. Now it was lovely food and the setting is to die for . The desserts were epic in fairness BUT id go for the light lunch if I was going again due to cost and choices for kids. It got cold and windy too up there so earlier in the day is probably more comfortable temperature. 
I'm envious of anyone going for the first time because quite honestly the view is mind blowing. ENJOY !",,Jul 2024

Five minutes later she realised that the very polite staff weren't going to accommodate her as the restaurant was full. I almost interrupted her to tell her we booked 10 months ago!

The second main course was a rice and squid dish with a lovely yoghurt dressing however, the rice was heavy and stodgy. We were recommended a local expensive red wine which was vinegary and undrinkable - which we left half the bottle. The venue and view were stunning and the staff were really attentive.

Service was very good, efficient and friendly. Pricing is a little steep compared to other places in Dubrovnik. For example a Karlova 0.5ltr of beer is 9:40 euros. A bottle of 0.25ltr Sprite is 3:35 euros and a 0.125ltr glass of Casa Rose Kutjevo 9:20 euros. Our bill for just a few drinks and two portions of chips was 147:20 euros and that was without any tip included. Make sure you have lots of cash or a very good credit card as you will need it😒.

Oscar O,"Tarragona, Spain",Spain,2,null,null,null,null,"We had a reservation on 4/9/2024 at 6:30 p.m. for a couple of months in the front row. When we arrived at the restaurant, at the indicated time, exactly 6:30 p.m., we were assigned table 13 and when the girl served us, she deleted that table and put us at table 32. (We don't know why)

Once there the waiter took our order around 6:40 p.m.
Around 6:50 p.m. they brought us drinks.
and until 7:31 p.m. they didn't bring us the 3 dishes we ordered.
Which one of them was a lettuce salad, which apparently they went to look for it in the garden, because an hour to serve a salad is a duty court.

We told the waiter that the service was very bad and slow, he replied that it was because they had large groups.
Which was a lie because the two large groups that arrived sat down around 7:15 p.m. and were served 5 minutes later than us.
When we asked for the bill, we saw that the waiter gave us a discount of €7.86 and told us that with that it was already solved. We did not want any discounts, but better service, because what had to be a romantic and unforgettable evening, turned into a nightmare due to the terrible service of the waiter and the initial attention. And to top it off, when we were leaving, we told the waiter that it was a disaster of attention and service, the phenomenon told us that it was the kitchen's fault, when he is responsible for putting pressure on the kitchen if he sees that it took an hour for us to wait. that they serve us the dishes and even more so when tables that arrived just 5 minutes after us, had already finished dinner when they had not even served us.

I would recommend booking in advance as it does get busy here and it can take a little time to get up and down in a taxi as the roads are so narrow, so allow plenty of time.

The images on the website are not an accurate portrayal of the quality, location or ambiance - the dining area is incredibly casual, as is the majority of Dubrovnik (everyone was in trainers/ some were in sports wear). I must admit it didn’t help that we were moved inside due to poor weather conditions - I can imagine it to be a beautiful location in the summer months.

Panorama is a beautiful restaurant. Obviously great views but also a lovely ambience and excellent service. 
And on top of that the food was delicious.

Normally I would consider that restaurant a tourist trap but instead it is fine dining at its best. Starting with the wine, with a nice selection, then the bread we ordered with some tasty olive oil we knew we were going to enjoy this meal. Two of us got the daily chicken and vegetable soup which was loaded with flavor. My girlfriend and I each ordered a dish and split them so we could taste two dishes. We got Risotto w/shrimps & courgettes and Sea Bass Fillet. My husband got the Dubrovnik Style Cutlet (Pork Chop) and her husband got the Sea Bass as well. The presentation was gorgeous and the flavors were amazing. Then we split a cream caramel, which is similar to a flan with yummy cream. The presentation was eye catching. And everything on that plate had a purpose. The sauces definitely complimented the dishes. My hat is off to the chef/assistant chefs. They did an excellent job of preparation and presentation

Our server was outstanding. He anticipated our every need. The manager was going to seat us outside but the wind was picking up so he gave us a great seat by the window. He is a good friend of our driver so I am sure that helped.

The views are stunning! You can see the huge entire walled city. The restaurant itself is very stylish and reeks elegant dining. We are so glad we had the opportunity to dine at this restaurant.

The get to the restaurant you have to take a taxi or the cable car. Taxi's from the old town have put their rate for the short ride at the same as 2 persons in the cable car: 55 euro.
So before you get there, that's the first part of your bill. The rates for appetizers, main dish, dessert are the same high levels as in the old town (overpriced) and the drinks prices are excessive.

We had to book about a month in advance (online) to secure a lunch reservation (no evenings available) so book ahead.

The menus are great, something for a lighter lunch and also dinner which was perfect for us as with two fussy teenagers we were finding it hard to keep them happy.

We went for the chicken burgers and sweet potato fries, the beefburger (served plain with no salad as requested) and the risotto. All were fresh and tasty - portions were just right and it was served beautifully. As was the service - not too slow, but leaving us enough time to enjoy our view (dining slots are for 2 hours) and more than happy to take pictures for us. Our lunch for 4 plus bread, two cocktails and two beers came to 162 Euros. We'd paid almost as much for ordinary meals in the town.

Don't be put off by the price of the cable car which is 38 euros each return. You don't have to use it to get to the restaurant. On the morning that we went it was windy so the cable car was closed. We got an uber from Babin Kuk costing 22 euros for all of us and then got the cable car down when it opened later for 60 euros total. Best of both worlds!

I had booked a table for a front row seat a couple of months before as I’d heard the restaurant was very popular, I was at the front but I was quite high up so not exactly what I was expecting but I was 5 minutes late so maybe that could have been why. You could only book a table for the front row at 6.30pm or 9pm so just bear that in mind when booking. We got a taxi to the restaurant up some very windy roads, but it was the same price as the cable car so quite expensive to get there at around 40 euros round trip but the view is beautiful and the food lovely too. I had the orecchiette pasta which was classed as a starter but for 22 euros I assumed it would be a larger size but it was still pretty small but it was really delicious and my husband had the pork which was so tasty.

We had a table booked at 1830 on the mountainside terrace, they said they wanted to upgrade us and offered us a front seat view of the city inside the restaurant, obviously we snapped their hand off at this. However when we were taken to our seat we were stunned with the massive metal bar that ran parallel with the window from the cable car, probably blocking 50% of our view. We asked to move a few tables along and we’re told they were reserved despite not having a reserve sign on, then to our annoyance another group asked to move to a similar table next to it and we’re told that it was ok…. The Food was excellent, really good quality and felt quite special to match the vie at every table but ours. The only reasonable priced thing on the menu was the bread which was actually really good for 3€. Now onto the service itself; the starter came out in quick time, was lovely and a good portion. The main however was a 45 minute wait….and only on prompting the wait staff (who completely ignored our table for the majority of the meal) did the food suddenly appear. With only two waiting staff for the entire inside restaurant, service was non existent. After trying to get their attention on numerous occasions, they bypassed us. Whenever they did come and take our drink order/ when we asked for the bill, they were completely distracted and took so long to get anything to us. 
The quality of the food brought back a little bit of credit to the restaurant, however the table service plus the blocked view left a bitter taste in our mouth (pun intended).",,Aug 2023

Once there, the terrace was also closed because of rain. But, they seated us at a window table inside overlooking Old Town and it was clear enough to really enjoy the amazing views. Normally you would think a restaurant at the top of a gondola ride would be poor quality but this is the opposite. This is a high quality restaurant that just happens to be in an amazing location. Our party of 4 all had different types of meals from shrimp risotto (which got rave reviews), to Dubrovnik style pork cutlet, to a basic cheeseburger.

We were advised we could only have the table for 1hr 30, rather than the standard 2hrs 15 which we were fine with. In fact, there was no rush and we were not moved on. We both had the risotto starter which was delicious, followed by salmon and steak for main course. The salmon was very good, although my partner did say the steak wasn’t as good as others he has had. The menu choice here for both food and drink is very good and the service we received was excellent. The prices are a little inflated, I guess because you are paying for the view.

flashsam7267,"Knaresborough, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"Decided a few weeks before coming to Dubrovnik that I wanted to eat here after hiking up the mountain.

I emailed them in advance to book a table (and request a good view of the old town, which they honoured!)

I honestly thought that the prices were expensive due to the amazing location and that the food wouldn't match up to the prices, but I was very wrong.

I had the burger which was amazing.
I've had a few burgers already in Dubrovnik and they've all been good so far (I check a lot of reviews before deciding where to eat my burgers!)
But the burger here was the best I've had so far.

Very good meat. Cooked well with a great meaty taste and very juicy. Lots of really strong cheese and fresh shredded lettuce. All served in a soft fresh bun.
The fries that came with it were already very good. 

My wife wasn't very hungry so ordered the side of grilled vegetables. 
Good sized portion of different veg (peppers, aubergine, courgette, onion, tomato) and all very nice.

She also ordered the 'bread selection' which was 9 good sized pieces of very fresh lovely squidgy bread. Amazing considering it was only €3!

The service was also very good and even though a lot of the tables were reserved we didn't feel like they were rushing us at all. If we'd sat staring at view for another hour I don't think anyone would have complained.

My only minor criticism is that the restaurant has no toilets. You have to walk back up the steps to the main toilets at the viewing platform/cable car station (which are very small and obviously shared with all the cable car visitors)

Overall an amazing meal and I'd happily eat here again.",,Jun 2023

It was nice to get some simple but very good food, had some chicken burgers and a steak sandwich. Finishes off with some cocktails and some of the best we've had in dubrovnik and we've tested out quite a few!!

Staft were great and they adapted my booking for me to a table of 4 rather than 2 tables of 2 as they didn't have availability on the day.

Book well in advance if you want a table as its very busy. Also maybe take a jacket or cardigan with you, only time we were cold in dubrovnik, there was a bit of a wind and we were in the shade.

We got an uber up and back down, the price of cable car for 4 of us would have been 120e when the uber up and down was 40e. Crazy price for 6 mins up and down on the cable car.

Perched high on the mountains, overlooking the city and the Adriatic sea beyond. If you are afraid of heights, perhaps ask for a seat away from the edge. Otherwise it's breathtaking. 

Then there is the food. I had to try the Dalmatian smoked ham with olives and sun-dried tomatoes. It was delicious - the portion is significant but light enough so as not to overwhelm you before your main. My wife enjoyed the Pumpkin soup (with bacon and marscapone) very much. 

For mains, my wife had the chicken - which was cooked perfectly and paired well with potato, carrot and kale. The jus elevated the dish further. 
I had the veal with mushroom risotto. The veal was tender, subtle and everything I feel we are missing with our cultural aversion to such delicacies in the UK.

I made a reservation for a party of 2 over a month in advance and only got row 2 on the terrace. I had read that sometimes it's possible to get ""upgraded"" to a first row table, if those who reserve those tables do not show up. Alas, the restaurant was not able to move us to a first row terrace table when we arrived for our reservation. However, what not the only reason we were disappointed with our experience. It was a chilly evening and heaters were brought out for tables. Staff were bringing out individual heaters for each table. No one ever brought a heater for our table. The only heater close by was aimed at the table next to us. Later, the couple at the table next to us was offered to be moved to a first row table, even though they were done with their dinner and was just getting some drinks. The staff then quickly cleaned that table and seated another couple there. Not sure why that other couple was moved instead of just seating the new couple at the first row table that was vacant. Also, not sure why we weren't offered the first row table instead as well. After we finished dinner and our plates were cleared, no one came to check on us to see if we wanted dessert or the check for more than 20 minutes. I had to track down a server to ask for the check.

I e-mailed a few days in advance to secure a reservation, and we were given a table right at the front of the restaurant's outdoor terrace with a 5* view of Dubrovnik. They did accept walk-ins but you will likely be given a table nearer the back, away from the best views. The staff were friendly and professional. There was a button on the table which you could press for service. The food was delicious, I would recommend the Dubrovnik style pork cutlet.

400 metres above the old town, the tables perched on the edge on the cliff have the most stunning view. Essential to book ahead to get the best tables. The tables have umbrellas and IR heaters. There is an inside dining room within the cable car station.
The food and service was excellent, with a good choice and also a good selection of Croation wines. 
A particular favourite was the Prawn and Courgette risotto starter, which was extremely tasty and easily enough to share. Prices are on a par with the old town, but with the added benefit of the view, makes this a ""no brainer"" to visit.
The cable car return is 27 euro per person. As a group of 6, we took an Uber up from the old town for just under 30 euros, which was very good value.
This is one of a group of three restaurants in the town, and when paying the bill, they give you a card showing all three. The card gives you a 10% discount when dining at any of the restaurants. We had already dined at Arsenal, and used the card successfully here.
Highly recommended on a nice day.",,Apr 2023

Service was impeccable, too. Our waiter Blaz was super attentive, he offered to take a picture of us and made sure everything was perfect!
Price-wise, Panorama is way more honest than all the places in the Old Town where you get bad quality for a ridiculous price. At Panorama the price equals the high quality and the stunning service/atmosphere. It’s like eating in Paradise.

We ordered the beef lasagne and Chicken “Rustico” with potato mouse, marinated kale with sage sauce. The lasagne was quite a large dish, but it was very good. The chicken arrived with a separate jug of sage sauce, the chicken was really tender it was lovely.
We had 2 Pina Colada cocktails and they were one of the best I’ve ever had.
It’s a shame it was so cold it would have been nice to stay long as the scenery was amazing. I would definitely recommend a visit.

We sat down to eat whilst the sun was still up and ate and drank as the sun went down, watching the old town below start to light up and it was beautiful. Very romantic too! The most gorgeous location we’ve ever eaten at (and we went to Hawaii for our honeymoon!) 
The service was fantastic, Vedran! What a lovely man! Very attentive, friendly and funny; kept cracking jokes and made the experience even better. And the food!!!! Oh my goodness, delicious! Portions were very generous and because we got up there a little earlier than planned, we had time to let out huge two courses go down before sharing a delicious dessert (chocolate walnut cake…*drool*)

We took the cable car 🚡 up and back down which was expensive at £20 each but for us was part of the experience, locals suggest trying to find a local who will drive you up the old road for half the price but we wanted the experience.

We booked our table for 17:30hr which still mean we could order on the lunch time menu as this food was more to our liking and much much cheaper! We also planned this with the sun setting at 18:22hrs knowing we’d have a beautiful view over looking the whole city. The cable car only runs until 21:00hrs so again useful for getting back down on time.

There was a heater and blanket each to keep us warm as sadly as the evening went on the wind made it rather chilly however these added touches help perfectly but I’d advise taking a jacket.

My wife ordered a cocktail which she said was one of the best she’s ever had and I pint of larger. We both ordered mains and a pudding to share which was huge as one of the cakes of the day (cheaper than the ice cream). The total bill was £66 and the best meal and evening experience we’ve had in Dubrovnik.

Our other dining experiences in the old town were average at best. Sure this place is expensive, but the quality is so high. I really wish I’d gone for the steak as there were so many flavours on my husbands plate, but the calamari and rice was also very well executed.

Service - which seemed to be a bit of an issue in the other restaurants we visited- was exemplary. It was a cool evening and we were very lucky to be able to be fitted into the main restaurant rather than sitting outside.

The queue for the cable car at sunset was a lot bigger than we had anticipated, so leave a bit more time than you think you’ll need.

We heard, from many people, at the top of the ride awaited an amazing restaurant, Panorama. We didn’t have a reservation and planned on having a cocktail while on the beautiful patio overlooking the spectacular, expansive view of Dubrovnik’s old town and walled city.

Much to our surprise, after inquiring for a table, we were seated immediately for dinner. Seating is available indoors and also on a large, multilayered patio, all with unbelievable views. Every table outdoors was full…we were so lucky to be seated so quickly. 

Our amazing server, Blaž, greeted us and offered wonderful suggestions for appetizers, dinner, and wines. He was incredibly thoughtful and friendly. 

Blaž asked if we were celebrating … and we told him we were! My husband and I were enjoying our 35th anniversary … with our daughter, who recently had her 28th birthday. We planned this trip to celebrate both special occasions before our daughter left for a 9month Broadway tour.

After being served two deserts with huge fiery ‘candles’, Blaž and his colleague rushed to our table, gathered our wine glasses, desert, and all utensils…told us to “get up…get up, and follow us!” Blaž moved us to a table with an even MORE INCREDIBLE view….I literally cried tears of gratitude. What an amazing experience.

Thank YOUUUUU, Blaž and the entire Panorama staff! What a magical night!",,Aug 2022

Just as importantly though is the customer service offered by their management.

Chinchitchlud,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"We came here for our last evening in Dubrovnik, I would say pre-booking is essential. We pre-booked about a month before visiting and were only able to secure a 4.30pm table. We decided to take an Uber to the restaurant due to the queues of the cable car. Uber cost about £15 each way and was cheaper than the cable car as I believe that works out about £20 per person, each way. 

We arrived and were seated straight away, we had booked a second row table as that was all that was available but we were lucky to be upgraded to a first row view and it was amazing.

We ordered a selection of cocktails and 2 steak sandwiches, food, drink and service was amazing. We had a 2-hour booking and the time flew by.

Prices are slightly higher than most places but I would say it is worth it as a one off!

Charlotte Y,null,null,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"I booked this for our first evening in Dubrovnik so we could overlook the old town. The view was everything I hoped it would be. We were running late due to traffic - HUGE TIP do not take a taxi here, get the cable car as we made the mistake of going via taxi and it took so long and the road approaching the restaurant is a single track but two ways so it just gets grid locked... we got out and walked in the end and got the cable cart back to the old town after our meal. Luckily, I called ahead and explained and the staff were great, I was concerned we would loose our table but they held it for us. Once seated and more relaxed the service made us feel even more settled - attentive and polite. The waiters have time to talk to you and take photos if you ask. At one point my other half got up and knocked the table which sent one of our drinks flying. The staff were great and replaced it for us. The food was amazing too. The only thing which lets this place down ever so slightly is the toilets as you have to walk all the way around to where the cable cart is coming and going and the toilets have a bit of a public toilet feel to them. I would recommend a visit to Panorama to everyone staying in Dubrovnik. Make sure you book to see this in the daylight and as the sun sets too!",,Aug 2022

We had made a reservation for 6pm so we were able to get seated right away in a very nice table with a breathtaking view of Dubrovnik. Our incredible waiter, Vedran, came by to take our order for drinks and food very quickly and was really great at giving us recommendations/checking in without making us feel rushed at all. He was amazing! We got some delicious complimentary free bread for the table (three types: one with seeds, plain white, and egg bread- reminded me of challah?) with olive oil and balsamic. All delicious. For food we all shared:

Assorted Cheeses and olives: this was a perfect appetizer to share! Came with bread, olives, plumpy sundried tomatoes, and different types of cheeses that ranged in textures and flavors but were pretty mild overall and not overpowering.

Octopus Terrine: amazing dish! Has generous amounts of octopus with a creamy sauce that balanced out the flavor of the octopus. One of my favorite dishes of the night. Super fresh and high quality. 

Beef Carpaccio: another great dish with thin slices of raw beef, complimented with Dijon mustard, Parmesan chips, and this delicious truffle dip. Comes with this very light and thin bread on the side so you can pair them together. 

Sea bass fillet: in a white wine and butter sauce with clams. Literally so amazing. The sea bass was grilled to perfection and felt very fresh. Came with plenty of clams and had that delicious sauce which really brought the dish together and complimented the flavors of the fish. 

Slice of cake of the day: there were 4 cakes of the day (cheesecake, white chocolate almond, apple) but we opted to get the chocolate and walnut cake! This was out of this world. Not too sweet itself and we asked for a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Has lingonberries which were tangy and really balanced the chocolate flavor. It also comes with shaved almonds, and little crumbles of biscuit that adds a mild crunch to this dessert!! 

The food was obviously outstanding but the ambiance was unreal. They had romantic/calming music playing the whole night at the perfect volume which really enabled a great energy in this place. We were able to keep the table until 8:45 so had the opportunity of seeing the amazing sunset from up there with all the tasty food. Truly one of the most memorable dining experiences of my life! Prices are reasonable, service is outstanding (shoutout to Vedran again!), and the ambiance is unparalleled. So happy we came here and I would highly
recommend to anyone who finds themselves in Dubrovnik for the first time.",,Aug 2022

Service is what I gave 5 stars for, ultimately. Professional, pleasing and highly efficient.
The standout dishes were the octopus terrine, the meat was so soft and melt in the mouth, with amazing flavours complimenting the dish, and the sea bass was just perfect! The fish was so fresh and done well. 
Breads and dips were offered generously before the mains arrived.

We waited 5/10 mins for a table for drinks, were then ignored for 30mins to get a drink. By this time it was just gone 8.30pm. There appeared to be no system to their bar drinks and even though it was busy and they evidently couldn’t keep up they continued to accept walk ins for drinks. Finally our drinks arrived. At 9.05pm we politely asked if our table was nearly ready (the family next to us confirmed they were 8.30pm and were just being sat down 30 mins late). We were told we were next, all being quite hungry we decided to sit it out. We sat at our table at just after 9.30pm (45 mins late) and were promptly ignored further. We again asked if we could have some service and were smiled at but no action. At 9.50pm (1hr 5mins) without any sign of food/drink or even a waiter - we gave up!

Paul J,null,null,3,null,null,null,null,"Mixed review today, we booked via out concierge, who phoned them and confirmed the time.

When we arrived there was no sign of our booking, we where asked to wait and offered a cocktail whilst they investigated, eventually the manager came over, making us feel like it was our fault and said he would try and sort a table, after an hours wait whilst he contacted our hotel he came over and said they had a cancellation and we could sit there, again making it feel like it was our fault.
We had an enjoyable meal nothing more nothing less, considering its part of the Nautika restaurant which we rated so highly, but always felt like we where the liars, on returning to our hotel I consulted with out concierge (petra.....who has been excellent with our other bookings) and her manager, who both confirmed they had done everything correctly including confirming out booking by phone.

I think the problem with the restaurant is they are so busy they over book to cover cancellations and do this quite often, as the manager as much said the hotels do it to get their commissions, something I doubt very much with out concierge",,Jun 2022

Although this is what attracts many people, the menu and cocktails also are excellent, as is the wine list. We enjoyed several interesting and creative cocktails, but Panorama also has all of the classics. The menu has a nice variety of seafood and meat dishes, as well as risotto and pasta based on fresh local ingredients. It is also important to note that the service was outstanding -- our waiter was very professional but also fun and a pleasure to speak with. As others have noted, you should reserve a table well in advance -- Panorama has a lot of reasons it is one of the most popular restaurants in Dubrovnik.",,Jun 2022

I had the seafood linguine to start (which easily could be a main) and the sea bass for main. Both were lovely dishes and fresh fish. My husband had the pork cutlet which he also enjoyed.

You MUST book this restaurant in advance if you want a decent table. I booked it a couple of months before coming and still could only get a second row. However, our friends went in the day without booking and got a front row so it seems the evening is the busy time.

Our favorite was probably the Dubrovnik style cutlet with Sea bass filet and veal with forest risotto right up there. Linguine with shrimp and sea shells, pasta orzo a la risotto with shrimp were yummy too! All dishes were fantastic. Highly recommended, especially with Sinša and Josip's help.

MsRambler,"Cork, Ireland",Ireland,4,4.0,5.0,5.0,null,"First let me say that this was hands-down my boyfriend's highlight and favourite meal of our entire trip. For me it was a little bit tarnished by my reservation process.

First the pros and there are many. The views are stunning and there is a sense of excitement building as you reach the top of the mountain via cable car (you can drive up also but we wanted the cable car experience). Our table was beautiful with views out over the old town and to the sea. I had deliberately booked for sunset and it did not disappoint. We had cocktails which were good. We had soup and seafood linguine to start however it was the delicious steaks cooked to perfection that really delighted us. Our waiter Braz (I think), despite being very busy with several tables was polite, welcoming and professional. He kindly took out picture for us and is an asset to the restaurant. Wraps and heaters were provided when the sun went down and the evening cooled.

Now to the only disappointing part of the evening. I made my reservation a month before the dinner and was told that we could have the table from 5.45 to 7.30pm, this was emphasized multiple times on booking, on confirmation of the booking, when we arrived AND when we sat down. However, unfortunately when we arrived (at 5.40) we were told our table was not ready, we waited until 6.05 to sit down which wouldn't usually be a problem except that they ONCE AGAIN reminded us that we would need to vacate the table before 7.30pm allowing us significantly less time to eat and adding a slightly rushed feeling to what was otherwise a lovely evening, we didn't order dessert as due to the delay in getting our table we didn't have sufficient time.

Overall I would still recommend this restaurant as its location was excellent and the food was delicious and our waiter did a great job.",,Sep 2021

When we did sit down the wait was worth it - we had a table right at the edge overlooking the Old Town - what a view. Wasn’t expecting much from the food / drink as the place felt like it could be a honey-trap for tourists but was pleasantly surprised. My burger was okay but my partner had a blue cheese salad which she was really impressed with. The drinks were good and the whole meal was not overpriced considering the view which was certainly worth a premium.

I don’t have words to describe the feeling it gave me. I reserved a table one month before I went to Croatia and asked for a nice table at 6pm. We had a tour that day and asked the driver to just leave us there instead of taking us back to our hotel. We were there at 4:15pm. The hostess told me it was okay that we are early. Then she prepared a very nice table, the most perfect spot to see everything. She told me I could have the table until 8 pm since my reservation was from 6-8. So my son and I took our time.

Was told we had the table until 7:45 pm which was fine because we planned to have drinks and appetizers, and go elsewhere for dinner. We were warmly welcomed and taken to a fabulous table. Despite the timetable, we weren’t rushed at all and fully able to enjoy the amazing views! We had radlers and shared the bread basket, creamy tomato soup and cheese and olive platter which was delicious and quite filling. Finished with espressos. My worry about the server’s reaction to us not ordering a full dinner was totally unwarranted - he was all smiles and when he served the food, he wished us an enjoyable meal. Of course the main reason to come is for the stunning sunset and views, which did not disappoint!! Words of advice though: 1) we opted to take an Uber from the old town rather than the crowded, expensive cable car. What we didn’t know was that drivers do not like this route up, which is windy and narrow and often involves having to back up or go on gravel in order to let the car coming down pass. We had 4 Ubers cancel on us before one picked us up, so keep that in mind. 2) Prices are double to triple what you would pay elsewhere for the same item. For example our radlers were 50 kn each but in old town they were 22 kn. Not complaining, just explaining. 3) if we come back to Dubrovnik, we would bring our own drinks and watch the sunset from the free viewpoint right next to the restaurant. Very glad we came, but feel it’s a once in a lifetime type restaurant.",,Sep 2021

Lucy A,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"I booked this restaurant 2 weeks in advance and still only managed to get a table in the second row from the sea without a direct view of the city below, so reservation is defiantly key far in advance for the best tables. (We still experienced lovely views from the 2nd row). You are asked to confirm your reservation before 2pm the same day to ensure they don’t give it away. 

To reach the restaurant you can pay a taxi/ bolt or experience the cable car like us. We paid 170 kuna for a return ticket each to take us to the top of mount srdj where the restaurant is located. The cable car took around 4 minutes or so, 26 people approx to a carriage leave a bit more time if you are going up for sunset at it was quite busy and we had to wait for the 3rd carriage to get up. 

When you reach the top you will also find a viewing platform and a gift shop. The restaurant has a handful of indoor seating but the majority is on the cliff Terrance. There are many stairs throughout the restaurant area. Each table/ chair has access to a blanket for when the temperature drops after sunset and also a heater. There is some nice chill music in the background too with a lovely candlelit romantic vibe. Although from the Terrance you cannot directly see the sunset as the sun drops the other side of their main building you can still experience from the various view spots. From the Terrance you can see all the city and Lokrum island. 

The service and waiters had top notch service - the best hospitality we experienced in all Dubrovnik. They were friendly, helpful, polite and attentive. 

The food was presented beautifully with a wonderful portion also. We had the grilled beefsteak which was cooked to perfection with such attention to detail on the plate and also how they serve it to you. 

This wasn’t a cheap meal, for 1 starter, 2 mains and 3 cocktails + 1 water we paid approx 160 euro but I have absolutely no regrets the food, service, atmosphere, vibe was incredible. I would defiantly recommend going to this restaurant if you can and even better for sunset.

. The views (obviously) 

. Something a little different 

Cons
. 2 steaks and 2 draft beers cost us £80. Although the steak was tasty and presented beautifully, we thought this was pricey for what we got. 

. Costs £20 each for the cable cart to reach the restaurant.

. Bookings for a table at the very edge (full view) are apparently booked a year in advance. We made our reservation three weeks in advance and told we would get a table in the second row (limited view). 

. Upon arrival, we were told it would rain later so they had to close the restaurant outside and we would be seated inside. It did not rain until we got back to Dubrovnik Old Town which was around 1.5hours after we were seated so it was a great disappointment that the restaurant denied us the full experience.

Our server helped us select a bottle of wine that paired very well with our food selections - so well in fact that we ended up ordered two. The beef carpaccio was a stand-out starter dish. I selected the catch of the day (Tuna steak prepared spot-on medium rare) and my friends had the veal and the salmon. Not only was the food delicious but visually stunning as well. We witnessed a man propose to his now fiance which was sweet to see. I imagine this happens often because the setting is romantic and beautiful. After our meal concluded the manager was kind enough to find us a high top table on an upper level for after dinner drinks. Service was impeccable, the atmosphere romantic and posh without being pretentious, and the views are second to none. Getting to ride the cable car to/from the city was a fun bonus.

I wouldn’t stay for dinner but I would go up for a pre-dinner drink on your way to one of the many other restaurants in the old town! 
Also a COVID note- the tables in the second row are mostly not spaced out in a covid friendly fashion so which I felt was something worth noting for nervous travellers at the moment.

Surprisingly, this is one of those restaurants that don't rely only on its view to attract tourists/diners, they also serve great food and have a large variety of drinks. 
I wasn't feeling very hungry, so had a salad, which came in a good portion and it exceeded my expectations. The mojito was aldo fantastic and well presented.

Of course, we knew the view that awaited and prayed that, on this occasion, the mist wouldn't come in as it did on our first visit, but the main reason for our visit was to eat lunch at this beautiful, quality restaurant, offering unparalleled views of Dubrovnik Old Town and the wider major city itself.
We had a tuna salad and a hot steak sandwich served with fries and salad garnish. We chose two excellent gins with top notch tonic as we took in the views from our mountain-edge table.
Staff here are very attentive and professional and it did not come as a surprise that the restaurant is part of the group that includes the Gradska Kavarna Arsenal on the quayside of Dubrovnik's Old Town harbour.
Everyone said it was very expensive but worth it for the view but we found it was worth it for the excellent food and the view.
Food quality was as awesome as the view and the bill did not have me reaching for my card instead of cash.
A cable car ride back down and a short walk found us in the Gradska Kavarna Arsenal for a final G&T before catching the taxi boat back to Cavtat.
Now here is a challenge for everyone - which is better? The Panorama Restaurant with its spectacular views down to Dubrovnik or the Gradska Kavarna Arsenal with its spectacular view of Dubrovnik Old Harbour?
For me, the jury is out on that one..... both are absolutely excellent venues for food and views!
The mist didn't come in and the view was amazing but, so too, you feel like a movie star eating in the lovely open ambience at the Old Harbour.
Well done to the Panorama team though. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with you this year.

My only tip is 6:30pm is still hot and sunny at the end of Aug. so I should have gone for a 7pm reservation.

Cocktails were sooo good! This place is the place to go for the view and service. The road up to the bar restaurant was really narrow and very steep obviously due to where it’s located so I’d recommend a taxi ride to it.

Huggymare,"Essex, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,null,"Despite three months’ notice for my birthday party on 12 August, no effort was made to provide a decent vegan meal. Dessert for my husband and I was an orange and a cut up apple with some berries on a small slate for us to share. Not good enough!

I cannot fault the setting or the table we had, but all we had to eat were grilled vegetables and a bowl of potatoes coming in at a whopping 800 kuna with the miserly fruit salad and a glass and a half of Prosecco with some table water. Don’t go if you are vegan as they have no interest in catering for your needs and we left hungry and upset.

The other members in cur party liked their food, but for us it was wholly disappointing and the two stars are given purely for the stunning location and the view from our table.

I really expected something spectacular as I was celebrating my 50th and my friend’s 60th that evening, but Panorama is not up to speed with vegan requirements and needs to move with the times. 

The first thing we were offered at every restaurant (apart from one) was vegetable risotto. Rice is nit the only thing vegans eat - Seitan and tofu are great sources of protein and wonderful dishes can be created with these ingredients.

Please take this review in the spirit it is intended - we felt short changed and I felt very disappointed with the small portions offered, especially with the fruit platter.",,Aug 2020

Hrvoje M,"Zagreb, Croatia",Croatia,5,null,null,null,null,"This year Dubrovnik was our summer holliday destination, so we decided to go to Panorama restaurant at hill Srdj. Instead of using cable car which is in my opinnion rather pricy, we hired an super-firendly local Taxy guy who drove us from our hotel to Panorama, to old city of Dubrovnik and back to out hotel for ridicolously 20 EUR.
When we came to Panorama, we were so amazed with the view in front of us that we became speachless for a whole minute - dropped jaws and eyes wide open was the best way to describe us :-))
Super friendly and elegant waiters welcomed us with a big smile and gave us a seat right to the fence, and enjoy the most beautiful view in the Dubrovnik for sure. Since we came in the morning, we just had a coffe and sparkling water, but out host told us that beside grat view, Panorama is famous for two more things: amazing beefsteak and wedding proposals each weekend - I believe him. :-))
To make a long story short; If you want to enjoy in amazing lunch, dinner in most amazing and romantic place in Dubrovnik at more than reasonable price, or if you just want to enjoy in a cup of coffe or a glass of chilled white wine, Panorama is simply a must place to visit because it' just that amazing.
If you are a guy and you have a girlfriend with who you want to spend the rest of your life with, Panorama is the perfect and the most romantic place for getting down on your knees and asking your future wife the most romantic question, and she'll say YES for sure! :-))",,Jul 2020

I had the caprese salad as starter which was lovely. For main I ordered the steak, it was cooked to medium rare as requested. I consider the side/garnish quite important and here they do pay attention to such. My only suggestion is to provide a bit more gravy. Staff was efficient and attentive.

 We also have to see the part that gives us great sadness: the old fortress that still maintains the wounds of war, holes in the ancient walls that show the sign of shrapnel and bombs. Digging into the rock you can visit a museum where you can see the horrors of this war.

Although we didn’t have a reservation, we were lucky enough in the third week of September to arrive at lunchtime and get quickly seated. Not long after we sat down one of the staff came over to offer us an even better table with an unrestricted view- a gesture we greatly appreciated, and which set the tone for our experience.
No one informed us that we were supposed to press the large button on the table to summon service...We were happily enjoying the view and our unexpectedly good fortune in securing such a great table and were unperturbed that we waited a bit, before our waiter stopped by and showed us the ropes! Our lunch was delicious, a touch expensive but not exorbitant given the location and the prices we found through Dubrovnik- ie, worth every penny. Service was discreet, friendly and appropriate. This lunch proved to be a real highlight of our time in Dubrovnik, and I recommend it highly. If you are certain of your schedule you probably should reserve in advance and not take your chances like we did!

Akka,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"Just had dinner tonight with my family. I don't think I can put in to words the amount of praise I have for this restaurant, it was utterly spectacular.

It started out a little weird. We had booked a table weeks in advance and I'm not sure if that was related to us getting what I would consider the best table in the restaurant (possibly one of the best in the world) with breathtaking views. But shortly after we were seated, this other couple got very close to our private table and stood right behind me in a cramped space trying to take a picture... I thought it would be a quick thing but they were there for an agonizing awkwardly long time... Staff spotted the issue and politely asked them to move on as it was quite invasive and rude. 

I can't blame really blame the couple as the views for eating a first class dinner were truly incredible, once in a lifetime sort of experience. Also I was a little flattered to have table envy, not something that's ever happened before and I don't think will ever happen again.

Our waiter was exceptionally polite and friendly and even took our picture for us.

Service to take our order was a little slow but I think it was deliberate to give us time to enjoy the sunset.

I ordered the chicken which I wasn't expecting much from by the description, but it was truly exceptional and I savoured every bite. I thought it was really high quality.

I suspect that meal will remain the stand out memory of our holiday. I highly recommend it, I also recommend booking as early as you can.",,Oct 2019

Best time to go would be during daylight so you can see everything although many go for the sunset. Highly recommend making a reservation so you can get the first row with a view of the old town. The second row gets a view of the ocean. Sometimes you can luck out as a “walk-in”. No dress-code for daytime, not sure about nightime. Portions were surprisingly generous, we were very full afterwards - but extremely satisfied! We had the Dalmatian ham and olive platter, octopus terrine as starters, then the Mediterranean squid and the grilled pork cutlet as main courses. 
Staff were very hospitable and offered to take our photo with the view in the background.

When we finally spoke to someone, he just said our table was nearly ready so to wait.
Once we were sat, we had a fantastic view for the sunset, the food was delicious and our service throughout dinner was attentive.
We paid the bill and left a generous tip (20%+), however, we hadn't said it was a tip so expected it to be brought as change for us to leave or not, as is our prerogative. We didn't see any of our waiters/waitresses once the bill was paid so it was not only assumed that the extra money was for service but they didn't come near is just in case it wasn't and we asked for the change. 
This just tarnished an otherwise enjoyable evening and to be honest, if our mood wasn't quite so jovial, I probably would have made a point of asking for the change despite my initial intention of leaving it as a tip.

MMG1,"Chicago, Illinois",USA,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,null,"Usually a restaurant with a view does not have very good food or it is horribly overpriced. I am happy to say neither is true at this restaurant. We had a party of 8 people and enjoyed a sunset meal. The cable ride up to the restaurant takes longer than you expect both because of the lines - people go to the top for the view on their own or to visit the museum or to have drinks in a separate area - glassed in cocktail lounge, and because it is an uphill walk of about 10 minutes from the main old town gate. Plan accordingly, especially at sunset - it can take an hour to get to the top.The majority of the time is because of standing in line. There are taxi drivers at the cable car line that will take you to the top for a reasonable fee and you can get the cable car down. You either pay for your tickets at a ticket booth halfway up the hill or wait until you get to the cable car station and see the extent of the lines. To get the view and pictures you have to be outside and the table seating area in the restaurant does put the cable car lines in most of your pictures - although with photo editing software you can get some of them out.

I ordered the walnut/chocolate cake and it had a very bland flavour which was not impressive at all and my husband ordered the chocolate mouse which was also nothing special, cocktails were pina coladas and they were just ok, adequate rum but not enough pineapple so balance was a bit off but service was terrible, we had to wait almost 30mins for them to bring our order.

Considering the price of our minimal order (200kn) I would recommend saving your money and eating at a resturant in the old town as the quality will be a lot better and not as commercialised - there are a few viewing platforms beside the cafe/resturant where you can enjoy the view instead.",,Sep 2019

Patty Flint,"New York City, New York",USA,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,null,"My visit to the Panorama Restaurant on Mount SRD was completely unplanned. Initially, I had just gone up the mountain to enjoy the sprawling views of Dubrovnik for free, but the spectacular sunset that accompanied the views deserved a lovely drink to match.

So I decided to pop into this restaurant for that particular reason, however, because of its unmatched location with uninterrupted views of the city, my expectations were that it would be more expensive than the already expensive restaurants in the Old Town. I was quite surprised to find that the pricing wasn’t all that far off from the pricing in the Old Town and it just made more sense for me to pay the price with a heavenly view at least.

Although I hadn’t made a reservation and the best seats were taken for most of sunset hour, once people began to leave the staff was courteous enough to move me to the empty spots with a view without me having to ask.

From first impressions, it seems as though this restaurant makes sure that its patrons are well taken care of regardless of the amount that was spent and that says a lot about who they are.

I would highly recommend them!",,Jun 2019

The views were amazing as we watched the sky go from blue to orangey-purple to dark navy.

We ordered a pasta carbonara and sea bass fillet with shellfish and leeks. The carbonara was just the right amount of creamy without being too rich. They were generous with the sea bass fillets and the leek and beurre blanc sauce paired perfectly. 

Service was fantastic and we liked how they came round to offer blankets to tables as the evening weather cooled.

Ula,"Basel, Switzerland",Switzerland,3,3.0,5.0,3.0,null,"We had a nice table with the view of Dubrovnik, although in the evening for dinner it is not as impressive as during the day. It can get chilly later in the evening. The staff was very nice and attentive. The menu is not very interesting, the dishes came so quickly that I suspect were prepared in advance and warmed up. Same with the desserts, they are all prepared sitting in the fridge, I did not enjoy a cold out of fridge apple pie. I can recommend this place for nice view and atmosphere, also you need to add 170 kunas per person for the cable car to get there, which makes the dinner expensive.",,Aug 2019

We went here on our last night and it was the perfect ending to our holiday. I booked a table for 18.30 so that we would be there for the sunset.

B Cr,null,null,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"This was one of the most memorable meals of my life. The experience from start to finish was nothing short of outstanding. The view is phenomenal, but was matched by the level of service, as well as the food. Frequently we've found that restaurants with a unique quality (like a phenomenal view/location) tend to be underwhelming in other aspects and do not deliver when it comes to quality of food. Every single person in our group of seven enjoyed an absolutely outstanding dish (I had the sea bass, my husband had the risotto and beef. We each scraped our plates clean). Their desserts (particularly the chocolate mousse they had that evening) were delicious. When the evening got a bit chilly as the sunset, they offered blankets to each person at our table. 
Special shoutout to Josip and Sinisa for their service during our experience, and to Anna for helping us arrange our reservation. This dinner was a celebration of two anniversaries, one birthday, and the final meal of our Croatia/ Slovenia trip. They made the experience unforgettable.",,Jun 2019

Service was lovely, I wish I could remember the name of our waiter to give him a special shout out. He was so accommodating and even took pictures of my group with the views in the background. 
The food was lovely! We went for lunch and ordered three burgers and a greek salad and there are absolutely no complaints here! The food was lovely, and drinks were cold on a scorching hot day! 
We booked online for a 2:30pm lunch, on the day I still had not had a confirmation email of our booking. I checked my junk mail and there was an email from them confirming my booking for 3pm which I responded to say that 3pm was fine. When we got there my boyfriends mum went to check us in, only to be told that my booking had been changed and was now for 4pm. We complained and they accommodated us and we were seated by 3:10pm (with lots of empty seating round us, so why the booking had been changed, I do not know). From then on we had an amazing experience at this restaurant!

We hadn’t booked but secured a table for 4 with fantastic views. The lunch menu was fairly basic and we thought it might be overpriced but we were very wrong! The food was amazing, service was fabulous and the view was something else! Yes it cost £100 for a family of four for lunch but worth every penny and put a smile on our faces. Will be the highlight of our trip to Croatia which other than Dubrovnik has been pretty disappointing in terms of service, friendliness and food quality.

Everything is really overpriced and the level of the food is mediocre at best. And then there's Panorama. Obviously, it is not the cheapest choice but at least the food is prepared carefully and tastes great. Also the service is impeccable. We visited this place both for lunch and dinner, surprisingly enough we couldn't order a single disappointing dish - everything was good. The waiters had also good knowledge of the local wines and recommendations were spot on.

The lunch menu was small but absolutely fine and we enjoyed some sandwich lunches with a couple of frozen pina coladas which were truly delicious.

A booking is definitely needed, we went on a Saturday lunchtime (booking was made on the Tuesday), as it is very popular which is unsuprising. No discount with the Dubrovnik card (although there sister restaurant/cafe at the bottom of the Old Town does offer a discount.

Their was one problem in that all of the sandwiches except for the Vegetable one (which one of our party ordered) come with chips. It doesn't really make any sense why the vegetable one doesn't come with them so one of of party had to pay extra for a side of chips. So not a full 5 star rating unfortunately.

A W,"Lichfield, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,null,null,null,null,"After catching the cable car to the top of Mount Srd which has an amazing view and cost 170 kuna per person: pretty steep for the duration you are on it. We stopped first for a drink at panorama before our descent and were wowed by the view and stone steps into the vast restaurant. Service was very friendly and efficient. However, watching the food come out, we were very tempted to order beyond our drinks. My partner ordered a classic burger which had a lot of salad and dressing on it and was tasty but quite pink in the middle. The chips were served in a small metal basket and were not greasy.

 I had the tuna salad of a lifetime served in a bowl with a light chapati lining it. The tuna was medium cooked and in large chunks laden throughout the layers of sliced spring onion, chunks of cherry tomato, cucumber, sweet corn chickpeas and borletti beans with fresh lime to squeeze...simply heavenly!

If you want the full views I’d recommend you book in advance. You need to get to the restaurant by cable car and this can get busy but we waited about 20 minutes so wasn’t too bad, we just went a little earlier because of our table reservation.

Neil WPC,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"Having discovered this restaurant by chance when visiting the top of Mt Srj for the spectacular sunsets, we wanted to eat here to mark our last night (of 14) in southern Croatia. However, we were unable to make a reservation as it was fully booked. But, we were advised by email that there be some cancellations, and as we were visiting the nearby museum of the war of independence, we went along anyway. The maitre d' explained there were no cancellations, but managed to find us a table indoors - not on the lovely terrace, but still next to the vasyt picture window with its magnificent views of the old town 400 metres below.

We were not disappointed. The food was delicious. I had the beef tenderloin carpaccio to start, followed by sea bass fillet, all of which was presented and cooked beautifully. My partner was equally happy with her octopus terrine and king prawns. We were also presented with complimentary locla liqueurs, which was a nice touch.

The service was excellent and attentive, by a young man in his first season at the restaurant. He was also more than happy to take photos of us with the beautiful view behind us. 

Yes, the prices are quite high, but when you consider the amazing location, the quality of the food and service, and the logistics involved in getting food up a 400-metre mountain with a single-track road that's not really suitable for large vehicles, then a premium is to be expected. The restaurant provided us with a lovely and romantic end to a wonderful holiday in Croatia.

You pay premium for the location, but the food is excellent on its own merit, and the service is impeccable, nearly fawning. The downside is that you only get a partial view of the town below if you do not sit in the front row – and those best seats in the house are apparently reserved more than a month in advance (we reserved with only 3 weeks to go). Because Dubravka and Panorama are “sister” establishments, you get a 10% discount at whichever one you eat second, so we used ours here. We loved the beefsteak and the “Chef’s Recommendation” sirloin for the main plates, and the Dalmatian seafood platter for starters was also great. Really good apple pie for dessert.",,Jul 2019

We got the octopus terrine, the sea bass with grilled veggies, and the veal with mushroom risotto. Everything was amazing.

We arrived slightly early with the intention of having a drink at the bar but restaurant staff took us too our table upon arrival which was excellent! Staff were extremely friendly and very efficient considering how busy the restaurant was. For starter my boyfriend and I shared the shrimp and courgette risotto which was beautiful, honestly cannot compliment this dish enough, and the Sauvignon wine we had complimented it perfectly! For mains we both had a beefsteak with a side order of chips, which were also cooked to perfection! We had a table right next to a view of Dubrovnik Old Town which made our meal even more enjoyable!

Domstaton412,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"My girlfriend and I took the cable car up to the restaurant at about 8pm for 170 Kuna each (round trip, up and down the mountain) and we were just in time to watch the sunset and see the beautiful city before it was dark - Once the sun was down, the whole of Dubrovnik’s coastline soon lit up with light and looked amazing!

Now onto the food and drink - we arrived and ordered two cocktails (90 Kuna each) and a bottle of white wine (300 Kuna), Both were absolutely perfect!

We were sceptical on the portion sizes for the starters so we just ordered one shrimp and courgette risotto (120 Kuna) which was to die for! The best risotto I’ve ever eaten, the only downside was that we only ordered one between us!

For mains, we both had a beef steak with a courgette crisp, potato and various sauces and garnishes (250 Kuna each). The steak was cooked perfectly and all the additions on the plate complimented each other.

Throughout the night, the service was good, not phenomenal as the restaurant was very busy when we arrived so it’s to be expected but overall we had a fantastic time at the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone visiting Dubrovnik!",,Jul 2019

Travel on my Mind,"Rochester, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,null,"Despite its lofty location and unparelled views across the old town and beyond, I was quite surprised how reasonably priced this place was, for lunch at least. It is by no means cheap, but it is certainly not extortionate either. 

Menu was quite expansive and included a good choice of lighter options for lunch – we both settled on the chicken burger which was nice and crispy, although perhaps a more standard shaped bun would have made it easier to eat as the chicken kept falling out of the bun when eating ! Drinks were slightly more pricey, but again not overly so. If you have visited one of it’s sister restaurants back down in the Old Town, you can claim a 10% discount

Big kudos to the staff who running up down all of the restaurant steps in the blazing heat in their somewhat formal uniforms.

The menu was unusual compared with other restaurants we visited whilst in Dubrovnik but the food was absolutely lovely, I had the pork cutlet, daughter had beefsteak (a good, perfectly cooked fillet) and both very happy with our meal choices. 

Our waiter was very attentive, suggesting we moved to a recently vacated table better placed for the view to enjoy the remainder of our wine after we'd finished eating.

None the less we showed up hoping a four-top wouldn’t show, and sure enough we got lucky. 

The soup special was delicious. The carbonara was not authentic and pasta over cooked. The steaks, both the filet and the sirloin were juicy and cooked perfectly. But honestly - croatia didn’t impress us with food anywhere. What’s winning about this place is the service. 

The manager was awesome. Friendly, funny and kind. The host Adriana (i think) was charming and sweet and our waiter was super. He made an EXCELLENT wine suggest (the black wine) and kept our glasses full the whole night. He made our experience extra memorable.

Eric D,null,null,5,null,null,null,null,"I don't typically leave glowing reviews and usually try to keep it as objective as possible with both good and bad, but our dinner at Panorama was tremendous. First shout out has to be for the service- our server Dom was GREAT. He noticed my girlfriend trying to get some photos as we arrived and offered to take her phone to get pictures from 3 different places on 3 different levels on the restaurant. He was obviously busy as it was right in the middle of the dinner rush, but he insisted and my girlfriend was ecstatic with them. 

He also recommended the Dubrovnik Cutlet (pork chop), which wasnt on my radar until he mentioned it. I ended up getting it and was very happy it was recommended. Good crisp on the outside and very well seasoned. Others in our group had the sea bass (also recommended by Dom), carbonara, and I think the last thing was a seafood linguine. All were very good, as was the Vegetable risotto we had as an appetizer. I was honestly surprised by how good the food was across the board, I had assumed that the real attraction at this spot would be the novelty/view, but it wasnt the case.

To give a good indication of price/value, we had a group of 4 and our total bill came to a little over 350 USD. Not bad at all considering we had appetizers, 3 bottles of wine, dinner entrees, and dessert. One of the bottles was ~$100, so kind of inflates the overall price.

The only negative will hopefully be something that others don't have to deal with, but useful to know for anyone visiting in the near future (our visit was June 16, 2019). The cable car going up to the restaurant is not running at the moment, so the taxis have kind of a monopoly on driving you home. Ubers will not come up the mountain to pick you up, so you're kind of at the mercy of the taxis. It's not terribly expensive, but more than it should be and the one guy we had to deal with was a jerk about it.",,Jun 2019

For some reason the manager kept apologising for this, yet we didn’t actually mind as we knew we were lucky to even get a table at short notice. Then as someone didn’t turn up to their reservation, they moved us closer for a better view.

The view is incredible. We got there in time for sun set and it was beautiful. 

The staff were just great, very friendly, and even though we were there until late, we were never rushed. 

The food was delicious, although portion sizes were a little out. Our starters were quite large. But then our mains were the same size or smaller. But everyone’s were nice.

The restaurant is at upper end of cost, but I personally think it was worth it. 

Unfortunately, the cable car has been closed so we had to get a taxi up. My god this was a scary drive! The road is not designed to accommodate such traffic, and I was in need of a strong drink by time I got to the top.

All in all a great evening.",,May 2019
ashleyB_187,"Chipping Campden, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,null,null,null,null,"We recently went to the Panorama restaurant with friends to celebrate our mini moon. 

Book as soon as you can we made a same day booking for sunset but weren’t on the actual cliff edge until a previous booking had left & we were kindly moved straight away. This for me is was the sign of an excellent restaurant completely knowledgable in why people go there.

First thing to note is due to the fabulous location the road leading up is a single track with passing Spots DO NOT DRIVE YOURSELF. There is a rule that going up takes priority rather than coming down. The road was full of experienced taxi’s and the odd tourist causing absolute chaos leaving and requesting too much room to pass. If your like me with heights have a drink before you go!!!!! Or close your eyes!! It took us 30 mins to get 3.5km on this single track road. 

When we finally made it to the top there is a layered patio with white umbrellas and turquoise detail giving it a very fresh vibe with trees and plants to give it a garden feel. As it wasn’t high season they had plenty of heat lanterns and blankets for later in the evening when the temperature dropped. 

Each table is given a dedicated waiter and a buzzer to contact the waiter. The service was excellent and attentive and ensured the glass was always filled even if the wine was expensive and overrated. 

Food wise we had 3 courses each which we believe was a 4 star rating given that the main courses were the same size if not smaller than the starters. Starter choices included vegetable risotto, seafood risotto & Ragu. Mains included squid, salmon & veal. We all settled on the chefs special of chocolate mouse for dessert which got 5 stars. 

In total for 4 people, 3 courses, 2 bottles of rose, 3 glasses of red the bill came to just shy of £300. 

There are restaurants of a higher standard for food dotted all over dubrovnik therefore we would recommend the panorama as a great place to have a drink whilst watching the sunset and sample a dish (starter main or dessert!)",,Jun 2019

And we started with a substantial charcuterie platter. Always smother your cheese in olive oil! Yum! I didnt know whether to stare at my plate or stare at the view most of the time.

Dan M,"Caterham, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,3,null,null,null,null,"We had a front row terrace booking that I had arranged for my wife and I months ago. Unfortunately, on the day the weather was against us and the rain set in an hour or so before our booking. As a result the terrace was closed which was understandable, but the disappointment is that there is no real alternative that can be offered to you. The indoor restaurant is small and has its own bookings so obviously not everyone can move inside. As a result there were a number of people in the foyer when we eventually decided to make our way back down the mountain to find an alternative restaurant for the evening. The staff were very good, very apologetic and even gave us a complimentary drink, nothing against them at all, but ultimately very disappointing that a bit of rain results in what was heading towards chaos when we left.
Another note, the cable car is closed. We heard as the result of tax evasion or government corruption, either way it won’t be open again anytime soon and this was all part of the appeal of the restaurant in the first place in our opinion so worth noting because the only way up/down now is via the single lane access road which becomes very chaotic in busy times.

We ordered Aperol spritzes for the table which were delicious! Then we ordered lunch, I had a fish salad with octopus, anchovies and shrimp, WOW SO GOOD!

You just can't ask for a nicer vantage point to share a meal while enjoying the sight of such a beautiful city by the sea.

The second reason is the staff, incredibly welcoming and kind, the servers spoke a variety of languages and exhibited a lot of good humor and grace during a very busy lunch time. Management obviously does a good job of hiring the right people and training them well. A manager even offered us a better table by the window when it became available - a very thoughtful gesture which was much appreciated.

The food is good if you keep it simple. we shared a very nice cheese platter and the toasted ham & cheese sandwiches were fine. The burgers weren't appealing to my beef loving husband.

If the manager didnt came to us when we went out of the restaurant and apology i would have gave zero stars but they had acted very well and gave us really good services. The food was little salty but the shrimp rissoto was fairly good. But the view you get is just purely amazing.

We were seated in a corner table with outstanding panoramic views, it was windy when we first sat down and as well as having blankets provided, one of the waiters immediately brought a heater over to us which we were very grateful for. We reserved our table from 5 pm to make the most of our evenings and enjoy the sunset. Shortly after we were seated a waiter came over to take our order, we asked if we could just order drinks initially and then food later which he was more than happy for us to do. We were pleasantly surprised by this as it made our evening more relaxed. The waiters were not pushy trying to make us order, we just gestured over when we were ready. The food itself was superb, both my husband and I had chicken rustico and the flavour and presentation was amazing. We also ordered 2 sides to accompany our mains which were both delicious. The restaurant is a little more expensive than places we would normally visit but it was totally worth it for the quality of the food, the service and the amazing views!

I had a cup of tea and my wife had a latte. I had read that this place was pricy, so we were kinda ready to be shocked,but really, considering that Dubrovnik is what it is the prices were ok.

For me at least this was the highlight of our trip. The staff couldn’t have been nicer and the view was to die for. We weren’t rushed even though they were busy enough. We spent a few hours here, but personally I could’ve stayed all day. Highly recommend this for the views alone.",,Oct 2018

Too often restaurants in such unique locations think that all they need to do is exist. With the Panorama, nothing could be further from the truth.

Yes, Panorama has a mark up, but considering the unique location (even by Dubrovnik standards) it feels quite reasonable.
We arrived some time before the 11am lunchtime (after visiting the museum - highly recommend the view from the Fort's roof!) when no food is available. However, the canny thing to do seems to be to bag one of the tables with an A1 view for a coffee and then just segue right on into lunch - which we did.

If you are visiting Dubrovnik, this restaurant is an absolute must. Booking a few days in advance is recommended, to ensure a table with the best views.

I had booked for 630pm in time to see the sunset and as we arrived before there was already a queue of people who hadn’t booked. We waited for our table in a drinks area so we could admire the views.
Our waiter left a bell on our table to call him when we had decided on our dishes.
The staff were very helpful and advised on dishes and wine.
As for the food...it was good but unfortunately our main course arrived cold. We sent it back and the replacement was only a little bit hotter. From our table to the kitchen it was a fair distance and if the food was not picked up immediately after cooking it obviously got colder by the time it got to our table. However it was tasty.
We were offered free desserts...which were delicious...and ten per cent off our bill, which was fair.
It was a pricey meal...even with the discount...but it was to be expected from this type of venue where the main attraction of this restaurant are the views of the old city and they didn’t disappoint.
In order to get to the restaurant you have to take a cable car and at times there are long queues so if you book a table make sure you leave extra time to get up there. It is worth booking ahead and asking for a table at the edge at sunset.
There were people waiting who hadn’t booked but had to wait for a while. There is a time limit of one hour and three quarters on your table. However because we had sent back our main course we were not thrown off and only left when we were ready.",,Sep 2018

The food is good quality for Croatia and has a more varied menu than you would generally find in the restaurants in the Old Town. the fayre we had was brilliant. I would suggest that you get the cable car around 10.30 and have a coffee or a drink before you explore the museum which is very interesting in itself. The queue was lengthy and you can buy your ticked from a booth prior to boarding so get in the line. A full ticket is worth it - return and museum. Having said that there is the option of a ride down the mountain by caddy - but you will need to explore that yourself. When you have done this you then get a voucher ( well our experience anyway) for a 20% discount if your go to the restaurant again. We then booked a table for lunch at 1.00 and just ate and relaxed until 2.30 and we were not rushed. We were able to get table 26 which overlooks the whole of the Dubrovnick harbour, walls and old town. For four with a drink ( and we could have done desserts which looked exceptional but did not) about £70. Drinks were quite expensive. Go on line to look at the menu.

Service was very slow. Each table had a buzzer which supposedly alerted the staff to come to your table, but this didn't seem to work straight away.

Whitney W,"Columbia, Missouri",USA,4,null,null,null,null,"I heard lots of great things about this restaurant and the reviews are pretty positive so I had pretty high expectations. I made our reservation about 6 months in advance which I assumed would guarantee us a front row table. We were seated in basically the second row so our views were obstructed and I was immediately frustrated. We paid 300 Kuna (round trip) just to get to this restaurant and then umbrellas, other guests, & distance significantly blocked our view. The food was fine, but not worth the 700+ kuna we paid. I had the pork chop special as recommended by the waiter with potatoes and bacon. Again it was just ok, nothing to brag about. Bryan has the ribeye and it was overcooked. The cheesecake dessert with strawberry sauce was pretty good and our waiter was wonderful! He was busy but very attentive and helpful. What would I change in the future? I’d skip the restaurant, bring a picnic basket and grab a spot on the rocks to enjoy the sunset with an unobstructed view!!! 

Also we got to the cable car 45 mins before our dinner reservation to find a ridiculously long line. Luckily taxi’s are standing by and we jumped in the taxi for the same price as the cable car.

Sarah C,"Dunstable, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"So so glad my friend recommended this restaurant to me- and now I recommend it to you!! 
To get to this restaurant you’ll need to take the cable car to the top of the cliffs, the round trip ticket cost 150kn (£17). If you just do the cable car alone I feel it’s a bit of an anti climax, as there’s little else to do. 

We visited in September, and booked a table for 7pm, there was no problem. My friend who visited in August said there was a big wait, so depending when you’re travelling to Dubrovnik you may find the peak seasons are full. My advice is to book as early as possible to avoid disappointment. 

Views are sensational here, you can see all across the iconic red rooftops of the old town, and the night we went there were fireworks in the harbour, which was the icing on the cake! 

Food was beautiful, even something as simple as roasted chicken and vegetables was cooked to perfection and so well seasoned and presented. The staff cannot do enough for you, you get a buzzer on your table and the minute you press it, a lovely waiter is there in seconds. 

This would be an ideal restaurant for an anniversary, proposal maybe, birthday - anything you’re celebrating, or if you just fancy a lovely evening. There are patio heaters and blankets too, a nice thoughtful touch for when the evening turns a bit chilly.

We arrived early and decided to have a drink in the BAR - not sure why this was called a BAR, this was a small area next the outside Dinning area, with a few tables and way to many people standing about, tables but no seating, NOT what I would call a BAR.

We were called and shown to our table which was lovely and the view was FANTASTIC, we ordered a glass of wine each and our starters, both really nice, we decided to order steak, (only reason for this is we had been eating sea food all week) 

Thinking this would be a great place to order a steak, I ordered the Rip eye (Medium) and my wife the Fillet (Medium Rare), the steaks arrived and they looked great, well presented with great service, BUT having started my steak I soon found this was not as I ordered - it was very Rare and my Wifes Medium Rare was Medium, My wife could eat hers but the was no way I could eat a Raw steak I spoke to the waiter who was great and extremely sorry, I was offered and new steak but my wife had nearly finished, thus not wanting to eat on my own I decided not too.

Overall Good Service but the STEAK was NOT good, hence not being charged for them.

The service was good, press a button and a waiter comes over. It did feel quite rushed, we were enjoying a pre dinner drink and were asked several times if we were ready to order. The food was good but not amazing and pretty average, particularly for the price you’re paying. I’m happy to pay more for the location but the food didn’t match up to the prices or the quality of food we had in Dubrovnik in other restaurants.

You can buy the tickets at the Cable Car but it is not always open as we found out so if you can, buy the ticket at your hotel or before turning up.

I would also highly recommend having a drink/lunch/dinner at the restaurant at the top as its really good, slightly expensive, as most restaurants are in & around Old Town, but worth it. Just sit there and enjoy your drink/meal overlooking the city. Wow! Try to pre book the tables but the edge for a better experience.

Being outside you should dress for the weather, and being on this rocky crag/crest, it is on many many levels and in no way handicapped-friendly. However the waitstaff is eager to please, professional, and quite prompt. Because of its many levels you have a button at your table that you push that calls your servers to your table when you have need. The menu is a bit large so hard to believe they can really do it all well but people seem to be relatively pleased with what they got for the price.

I booked ahead and was informed of my table when they confirmed my reservation, which was a row back from the edge, and still had a good view. I could see a number of couples arrive, who hadn't booked, that clearly had their nose out of joint because they weren't getting the best seat in the house. The staff were very busy but dealt with each situation admirably. This is my BIG TIP, book ahead, and you can go knowing what to expect.

The prices of food and drinks are what you would expect from an excellent restaurant.

Our waiter (Josip) was attentive and courteous. 
We were offered blankets when the sun dipped, to keep us warm. A lovely touch.

Note that you can only sit at the front tables with a reservation, so you are further back from the edge but it is still lovely. The waiters are attentive but also leave you to it and do not rush you. I had the Salmon and my partner had the Prawns. Both were lovely.

It is build into the hill and has different levels. We had no reservation and were 5 people. It took a while to get a free table.

Service was good everyone waits tables with a smile it was pleasant to see. In our experience Reataurants in Dubrovnik are more service oriented than the islands.

The staff could not have been more accommodating though and the food and wine was lovely.

As we ate at 8.45, we came up on the cable car at 8.15 with a handful of others. As mentioned on other reviews, the queues for going back down were extensive- presumably after the sunset rush.

We pre-booked from the UK and confirmed on the day as requested - our one misgiving was the possibility of the cable car (its a long walk) being queued up but booking early saw a respite in the wait and we were in very good time. On the way down the queue snaked around the street so caveat emptor.

The food itself was superb, perfect steak for my wife, a sumptuous and delicious veal risotto for me, washed down with a crisp and dry local bottle of Posip. 

The view is just amazing, the beauty of this place is that one can relax, enjoy a great meal, with great service but there is always that view, that astounding view to admire and enjoy.

I am a sufferer of coeliac disease therefore often worry about eating out however the waiter knew all about what was gluten free he was able to suggest meals with making alterations which would suit and there was even a gluten free pudding which was to die for!

Zarajaynee,"Coldstream, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,5.0,5.0,null,"We visited Panorama at the end of June 2018 and WOW what a fantastic experience.
We never booked a table and luckily there was space for us to eat outside however I would highly recommend booking a few days prior. I found prices very reasonable for the quality of food we were given - and what great quality it was.The chicken dish was beautiful and the side of chips made it just the right portion, the cocktails were also fantastic and we slowly worked our way through a few of them whilst watching the sunset. Lovely that the waiters provide blankets as it gets cooler - with it being on top of the hill it can get very windy so i would definitely recommend all ladies take a spare hair bobble!
I think what made this such a positive experience was the service carried out by the waiters - we were made to feel very welcome from the start and even though they were so busy all evening our glasses were never empty - a table with a view over the town became available after we had our meal and we were offered the opportunity to move to this table to have our drinks which was very thoughtful.

You have to pay for a return cable car which is about £20 each so it’s not a cheap meal all in all but it’s worth it. We went up for 19:00 and watched the sunset.

It also unsurprisingly isn’t cheap but you are paying for the view so it isn’t awful but go with your eyes open

For two people sharing a starter, a main course each and a bottle of wine (no dessert, coffee or apperitif) it cost £120.

For total naffness and to maximise the money they make you are given a buzzer to call your waiter 😀. A first for us....

We ordered the rib eye steak with rosemary potatoes. The red wine suggested by the waiter complemented the meat very well. The meat was perhaps I little over cooked. I asked for a medium/rear, I I got what I expect a medium should look like. My friends asked for a medium, and look more like a well done.

The Irish coffee we had for desert with our apple pie was kind of lacking on the ‘irish’ part. The apple pie was delicious.

Dinner was delicious, particularly the prawns however the inside restaurant was definitely not the atmosphere we hoped for on our last night.

The attentive and charming team made our visit such a joy - every single member of staff was wonderful, friendly and helpful. The chef and their team delivered our best meal yet with great wine and fine wine glasses, too. 

It’s was quite an extraordinary evening, with the beautiful sunset and warm sunshine thrown in for good measure. We thought it may be a little touristy when we booked it in London, but not at all - truly impressive and great value. 

We thoroughly recommend The Dalmatian Trilogy and the risotto with prawns & courgette & rosemary for starters and them the king prawns - king? More than that surely! These were huge sweet and succulent - seabream with mussels and clams - and the grilled squid, which was as fresh and tender as I’ve ever tasted. Side dishes were perfectly cooked and presented. The rose St Hills wine was excellent - as were the G&T s to start with. 

Thank you to everyone for a truly memorable evening. We shall not forget it!

My dad and sister had the steak sandwich and both said that it was very tasty and that the meat was very tender. My husband had the seafood risotto which again he said was delicious.

However when we arrived we were greeted by a warm and friendly host. I explained it was my partners birthday and we would love to eat here. She said no problem and we will of course get you seated by the edge with this she did explain it could be a longer wait. Which is fine with us - good things come to those who wait...she took us over to the right of the restaurant we’re there is 3 bar tables and what luck! There was no one to little people there for our waiting time. This meant a great photo opportunity and the chance for us to soak up the views of Dubrovnik with a drink.

There is also a good viewing area just past the restaurant (by the cross) so that may be worth a stop for some pictures before you go into the restaurant.

What cause this an upset visit was the differential treatment we received based on race and the inconsistency in how they handle reservation request. We had specified a month prior for the table by the side, we were told it would be a first come first served basis - fair enough. However what happened next was what caused the upset.

We arrived at the restaurant early, with 2 tables by the side available. The caucasian couple in front of our queue were led to the side table immediately but on our turn (less than 10seconds later) we were told to wait, and was subsequently led to the table in the middle, far off from the side whist the side table still being available.

Consistently we noticed all the asians were seated on the inside while the whites were seated on the side table without hesitation. We inquired again as to why the side table was still empty and we couldn’t sit there, the reply given was different from that of the email- the waitress replied a customer had specified the table number for reservation- seriously?

First, such option is not available nor offered, second upon our insistence (4 times, each with various inconsistent reasoning) we were seated there and no new customers arrived nor anyone making any noise as to why the table we were sitting on were occupied, which invalidates the excuse that that table was reserved with the number

URepublic,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"I booked the Buggy Safari for my son and I and also reserved a table for early dinner at Panorama for the rest of my family (4 of us). We had plenty of time to kill before the buggy safari so went for a wander before requiring some refreshments. There's only the Panorama to buy anything so we went there... very busy as you can imagine and it took a while to get a table which was a bit frustrating. I suggested to my wife we should probably leave as our buggy booking was approaching - the waitress made a comment I found a bit rude/ insensitive, and it was clear they felt my displeasure. After my son and I downed our drinks and left, my wife stayed with our daughter and told me the manager came looking for me to take feedback. He also gave my daughter a free ice cream. I found the service a bit poor initially, and was less than impressed... but when we came back for dinner at 4pm it was a very different experience. Excellent service, really nice waiter and good food. Our table was overlooking old town and the view was incredible. At the end of our meal, the waiter brought each of us a free desert and said he was aware we'd been in previously and had a poor experience. He said he wanted us to leave with a good impression... and we did. I felt bad and realise they'd been busy, and maybe I expected too much. I left a decent tip (at least I hope it was) and off we went, very happy. I believe we are all entitled to bad days, but the Panorama Restaurant really showed how much they care about providing a good service, and listening to customers when it doesn't work out. Excellent in the end!",,Jun 2018

Everyone could operate at a human pace, guests and staff alike. And there was air conditioning! As Dubrovnik gets hotter and hotter for the summer, that is a real plus.

My other half booked a couple of months in advance (not necessarily required but it paid off), as we got table 12 which were the tables with an incredible view over Dubrovnik and the sunset.

The staff give you a buzzer, so that you can enjoy the view and when you are ready to eat you can just call the staff to order. The menu had a lot of choice and we went for the Prawns (which were enormous) and the steak which was great. To protect my other halfs dress, the staff provided her with a napkin / bib necklace that went over her head. It was a nice touch as the napkin had a necklace printed on it which made it quite novel. We also had pudding, an apple tart and a hazelnut cake (the best puddings we had in Croatia). Yes we probably paid a slight premium to be up there for the view, but it was not more than a nice meal out in the UK that does not have the same view!

Our waiter gave us a button to press when we needed him which obviously didn’t work as we had to again flag down his colleague to order more drinks.

We pressed the bell to call the waiter numerous times without a response, we asked his colleague who said he would pass on the message but still nothing and finally after 40 minutes we got the attention of the maitre d who instructed him to clear our table. By then we had changed our minds about ordering dessert and asked for the bill.

We were greeted at the front entrance by a lovely and knowledgeable hostess who let us know our table would be ready shortly. It took under five minutes and we were given the best seat overlooking the Old Town of Dubrovnik and treated to excellent service throughout the meal. Our server, a younger, local gent, recommended our dishes and drinks and we began what was a very pleasant meal.

We started with the Dalmatian platter that consisted of thinly sliced prosciutto, fresh black olives, and an assortment of fine cheeses. The portion was sufficient for us to share as an appetizer and definitely lived up to the reviews we read online.

My wife had the chef's special recommendation: pork chops with mashed potatoes and crisp onion frites. She enjoyed the mash and meat, albeit somewhat overly salty. My main was the tuna steak (the fish of the day), served with a side of rosemary seasoned potatoes. I had no qualms with my meal and found myself sharing some with the mrs as she was having some difficulty with the amount of salt in her main dish (I, on the other hand, gobbled her meal down, salt or not!).

The view is absolutely exceptional and one of the best we've been treated to, although I feel as though this is incorporated into the price considering the meals were not the absolute best we had while in Dubrovnik.

Considering the location it could come at a high price but it’s not. Make no mistake this is not cheap but you won’t feel cheated.

The only off thing was the desert. A frozen cheesecake with a soggy bottom let down an otherwise great dinner.

The staff could do with scrubbing up on recommendations and wine suggestions.

jamesellispt,"London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,null,null,null,null,"I'll state the obvious here but this restaurant has a totally unforgettable setting. The views across the coast, over the town - and the terraced layout of the outdoor seating are quite spectacular! 
I would also note from scanning other reviews on this place, that our experience may have been an exception - rather than the norm. 

We showed up on Saturday evening after the sunset, with no reservation - but the friendly host had us seated within 20mins. On our way down the terrace the staff were all welcoming and upbeat. We were seated and given blankets by a pretty and enthusiastic lady (who I noted did nothing more for the entire evening!) 

The waiter had brought us drinks as we waited for a table at the top, and then as we went to be seated we were told assertively ""leave your drinks here, the waiter will bring them"" (we had just hiked up 1mile of steep hill so were feeling a little attached to them!) 
So even though I thought better of it, we went down to our table and .... you guessed it, our drinks didn't materialise. Nor any chance to make an order for more, or food. My girlfriend had to ask twice before finally fresh drinks were brought over unapologetically.

I got the impression at this point that service MAY be a little bit relaxed!

When we finally got the chance to order food (after a few attempts to get attention!) our main dishes arrived promptly and we were not disappointed: I had the Beefsteak with potatoes and my girlfriend had the Lasagne Bolognese. Well presented, fresh and filling. 

The it went a bit wrong again. 

No one really offered us any chance to get more drinks, and we sat for ages after our mains. If only we had known to request the dessert menu as soon as our man arrived to clear our plates...... but no - we missed our chance!!

I had grown a beard by the time the guy came back, and my girlfriend looked somewhat browbeaten. 

He asked if we wanted desserts but we'd already made a pact that we just wanted to get out of there by that point. He seemed surprised and disappointed when we said no thanks!

(Quite strange... but payment was taken very efficiently)

On the way out, all the staff smiled and thanked us for coming. I felt a bit of a warm glow, and noted again how stunning the terraced seating looked. I looked over at the cheesecake that I had secretly lusted after.

We got the cable car back to the Old Town and got something sweet from the supermarket ;-)

We couldn't work out whether our waiter was just really busy, or whether he assumed we were just going to be happy and amused for hours because of the view. Either way, it was a little frustrating. Assertive customers will do better here, and don't rely on being ""waited on"".",,Sep 2017

Firstly, the view here is absolutely spectacular. If you are able to get a seat by the edge (and don't have Vertigo!) make sure you DO, and if you can go for sunset then even better!
The staff here are very friendly and attentive, and helped us with food and drink recommendations.
I had the lasagne for my main followed by the cheesecake for dessert, both of which were beautifully presented and tasted gorgeous.
The service is lovely, and they even come around and offer you a blanket once the sun is setting to ensure you are comfortable and warm!
Also, if you are partial to a cocktail (which I certainly am) then their Cosmopolitans are fabulous..!
We will definitely be visiting again, a very special place for us both now.",,Aug 2017

It was fully booked when we phoned but with some help from our hotel, we manged to get a cancellation and what an amazing table - the first one in the front row - had a perfect view of the sunset. We arrived a little early so had a drink in the bar first. There was no feeling of being rushed even though they had queues of people enquiring about tables. Our food was all cooked beautifully. Service was perfect - not too pushy but enquiring if you needed anything and then let us get on with eating. They provided everyone with fleecy blankets as it got quite chilly once the sun went down.

We booked here rather last minute and in hindsight we wish we had done more research as the restaurant seemed to cater for the big coach parties meaning that attention to detail and high standards were somewhat lacking.

The service was impeccable; however the food just wasn’t up to scratch; plain, greasy and lacking in flavour which wasn’t altogether surprising given the food (sea bass and chicken) arrived within 5 mins of ordering suggesting it wasn’t cooked to order.

Surroundings: we had a central table but was moved to a window seat when one became available. It was a dark / windy / raining evening and where we sat we could see that much of the Old Town, however I would think a day time view was better. The atmosphere was just very strange. 

The starter was lovely, but the mains let the meal down. Just didn't do it for me. I wasn't excited by the food and didn't come away thinking ""oh that was really nice"". Potato mousse - mash.

flan_1969,Glasgow,Glasgow,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,null,"I had read many reviews before deciding to book a sunset meal at Panorama. With the mixed reviews we decided to go ahead and we are delighted that we did.

A few weeks before going I made my reservation by email and the correspondence with the restaurant throughout was excellent. I also re-confirmed on the day.

Our plan was to go up and down the mountain using the cable car (140KN each), visit the War Museum at the top, enjoy the daylight views and sit down to watch sunset and the lights of the city come on.

We did not bargain for the delay getting on a cable car as ticket holders took priority. So you should buy tickets in advance to ""skip"" the queue. This meant that we had to skip the museum which was a pity and we were ready to sit slightly early. We were informed that we would have a short wait for our table and we were soon shown to our spectacular seats. I a sure this was due to pre-booking and good communication. We had huge grins as we sat delighted with our fabulous seats with the most wonderful views.

We both had very nice starters, my wife the delicious local ham and I had a carpaccio of beef. My wife then had a nice spinach lasagne and I had squid.

Service was very pleasant throughout and whilst I found the buzzer we were given to call our waiter a strange practice, I liked that we were basically left alone to enjoy each others company, the food and of course the views.

The prices - yes it is expensive. We paid 800 kn which included a decent bottle of wine and two courses each. We did not go for most expensive items on the menu. The food was good without being fantastic, but in all it is well worth it for the view and experience.

If you want to spoil yourself or a loved one then go for it!",,Aug 2017

Use the walking trail to scale the fort on the top of the mountain. 20 turns, each single one is a beautiful place to take pictures of the amazing land- and seascape.

Martin A,"Warrington, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,1,null,null,null,null,"You can't beat the view, it is spectacular. My wife and I had a front row seat for the sunset, which was magical. However, it's a shame the restaurant doesn't match the view. My wife and I shared a Croatian meat and olive platter to start, she had the chicken rustica and I had the lasagne. 
My food was luke warm at best and my wife didn't rate her's either. The service was also reliant on you pressing a buzzer to get their attention, which felt like you were imposing on their work. 
Finally, within 2-3 hours of eating here we were both ill with vomiting and stomach cramps. Although, I can't say it was definitely something we ate here, it seems odd that this is the only place where we ate the same dish and more or less simultaneously got taken ill.

Panorama restaurant was delightful. If you want a seat by the edge (with the best view) make sure to book ahead of time and reserve a table! They provide blankets and heaters as the aid can pick up there. The atmosphere is wonderful, as was the food. We had a light lunch, the club sandwich and the steak sandwich. Both were very tasty. 

The view of Dubrovnik from the edge is just lovely and the sea stretches as far as the eye can see, from the other side you can see mountains which I am assuming is Montenegro.",,Sep 2017

It was worth the cost of getting up the mountain (we had hiked earlier in the day so opted for a taxi). The food was delicious, I had the prawn and courgette risotto, one had the seabass and two of them had the ham and cheese tortellini (I was quite jealous as the cheesy sauce was to die for!). Three of us then had a scrummy cake for desert.

Was quite cold after sunset (due to the wind) so maybe take a jacket. They also have blankets available. The food was only a little more expensive than other places we'd visited in Dubrovnik. We got the grilled beef steak and chicken rustica - both were delicious and well worth the price given the quality as well as the view. Staff were lovely and spoke excellent English. Only downside was the length of time we were left waiting with empty plates after we'd finished our meal - planned on getting dessert but didn't as the cable car back to Old Town closed at 10pm and we were concerned we wouldn't make it in time.

After the sunset when we returned to the restaurant they had reserved a table for us from a no show. And wow what a view. Looking down onto the old town with the bright coloured sky and the lights starting to shine below. 
The food was also great, my partner had octopus carpaccio to start and I had the tuna salad. The octopus was beautiful and we'll matched flavours. The tuna salad was massive as a starter and very well flavoured, for someone who loves dressing I didn't even need to add any. 
Mains were equally lovely, my partner having the chefs recommended which was beef cheeks and again amazing and clever flavour combinations, I had lamb shank which was tender and flavourful. 
Sure it's not a cheap meal, 2.5 courses each and a bottle of wine between us was 1000 kuna but you pay for good food and the experience. The staff were also attentive and respectful, and actually remembering and saving us a table shows the level of service they aim for.",,Aug 2017

Cue a long line waiting for the cable car and disorganised queue for tickets which meant we lost the place we'd had in said line. We got to the top a good hour after we had started queuing. We then had another queue to the restaurant only to be told there were no tables and there was a waiting list of over sixty people in front of us and so no chance for dinner... Fine but obviously very frustrating to have wasted all that time waiting when we had been told by the restaurant to come up!

Will,"Seattle, Washington",USA,3,null,null,null,null,"First, let's be clear...the view is amazing from the top of this hill. The restaurant has been able to capitalize on this and has an excellent location. 

We emailed for a reservation, but they were none available for the evening, so they advised we go to the restaurant to request a table on standby. We arrived and stood in line for about 15 minutes, upon which we were asked if we would like dinner or drinks. (Note: they will not allow you to be seated unless having dinner.) Since we wanted to have dinner, the hostess told us they ONLY had ONE table available. Also, we could ONLY have the table until 7PM, and it was currently 6PM. We took the offer, but after we were seated, the two couples behind us (who also did not have reservations) got better tables and were told they could have their tables until 7:45 and 8:15 respectively...mind you they were only seated 5 or so minutes behind us! The waiter who provided service was absolutely ... flat... no hospitality whatsoever. 

For dinner, we had the cheese tortellini and the beef tagliata. The food was certainly OK, but not at all up to par with the caliber that the restaurant claims. 

Ultimately, one should go here for the view. If you are seeking hospitality and excellent quality cuisine, I would recommend talking with locals who are able to recommend wonderful alternatives. We received excellent suggestions for our next night here that I cannot wait to try!",,Aug 2017

A little pricy maybe. I think we paid around 30€ for two cakes, a large bottle of water and a large beer. But as I said, it was worth it and only taking the cable car up would have been a bit of a waste.

The Panorama is the only restaurant available at the upper cable car station. It's an outside based restaurant with parasols.

When we arrived, there were staff 'guarding' the entrance. When we said we just wanted drinks, we were treated as though we were an inconvenience. Although the restaurant was quite busy, there were a number of tables available. We were given a table, ordered our drinks, and waited. 

After about 10 minutes, a waitress came over and told us that we were no longer going to be sitting there, as it was a ""table for 4"" and ""you have to sit somewhere else, as this table is only free for an hour"". Despite insisting we were only having drinks and then leaving, we were told we had to move to a table at the other end of the restaurant as ""it will be better, as it is for two people"". It then took an extremely long time for our drinks to be served.

The experience was unwelcoming and quite rude. It would have been better if we'd been asked to wait, rather than be moved from table to table.

The food in the restaurant is simply delicious, they have a variety of seafood, meat and vegetarian options. Everything we have tried has been superb. My personal favourite is the Prawns in a tomato sauce with garlic bread, a must try if you like seafood.
My main reason for writing this review is the staff, we have had Roberto the last two times we have been and he remembered us and that we were coming here for a wedding. The little details really made us fell welcome again. He was welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable about the food and wines.

Dubrovnik was hot that day and we thought the inside restaurant with solid glass on the very edge would be nicer, but reservations were needed so instead we eat outside which turned out to be great with the breeze and view.

You need to book unless you fancy a long wait and you need to leave time for the cable car ride up to it as this can also be very busy

This is not a cheap restaurant but not silly prices so we think it's good value

If you don't fancy the cable car trip you can get a cab from the old town up the mountain road which probably will take half an hour or so

Which is not to say the food, drinks or service are in any way lacking, but the prices on the menu are still as steep and breathtaking as the vista over Dubrovnik Old Town. They're worth it though: it's one of the most unforgettable settings I've ever dined in. The place operates as both a restaurant and bar, and you're asked whether you're there for food or drinks when you arrive and seated accordingly. The menu offers quite a range of food and drinks. I had the tortellini with Dalmatian ham and goat's cheese, which was very nice, and a frozen pina colada, which was refreshing but not the best I've ever had. The complimentary bread was very nice as well. My partner, mum and brother chose from the 'quick bites' menu (not what it was actually called; I can't remember now) and had a club sandwich, ham & cheese sandwich and cheeseburger, and while none of them complained about any of it, I didn't hear any rave reviews. With other drinks the total came to about €40 per person, and like I said, most of that was for the stunning location. Service was generally very good and very friendly, although the waitress who initially served us was rather unhelpful to me when I asked directions to the toilets (which are right up in the cable car station/upper restaurant building). The drive up to the restaurant is an experience in itself, with more than just sea views, although obviously you can take the cable car up from the town below as well (€20 return for adults).",,Jul 2017

Edward,"Bath, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,null,null,null,null,"We ate here on a flying visit to Dubrovnik, after visiting the old city during the day, the city walls just before closing. We arrived at the restaurant at about 8pm, and it was about 3 quarters full. 

We joined the queue for a table and realised that everyone was being offered a choice: sit on the left side of the restaurant immediately, or wait for a table on the right side. The left side has a view into the countryside and mountains, the rights side a view of Dubrovnik, the old city, the sea and the sunset. Everyone in front of us chose to wait. We said we'd sit on the left, and we're seated straight away. The view of the mountains was still stunning. The service was not the best, it was quite slow but not unbearably so. Strange given the number of waiters and waitresses walking around not doing much. We ordered drinks (a glass of local white wine each) and food (octopus for me and sea bass for my partner). After waiting for our food for about 10 minutes, the waiter then told us that a table had become free on the right side of the restaurant, if we wanted to move. We accepted, and the waiter carried our drinks to the new table. Our food arrived shortly afterwards, which was tasty but nothing special, but equally nothing to complain about. We were quite happy eating, drinking, and watching the kaleidoscope of colours as the sun went down. 

One word of warning: it is not warm once the sun sets. You are on the top of a mountain, and even without wind the temperature drops quickly. We had been out all day so we're dressed in shorts and t-shirts. They do provide blankets if you're cold, but this did take a while after we asked. Bring a sweater (maybe even wear long trousers if you can change before visiting) and you'll be fine.",,Jul 2017

You HAVE to eat here if you are in Dubrovnik just for the view alone- our dinner conversation was very stilted as all we could all do was to stare down at the amazing view, particularly as the sun started dropping and giving a whole different view of the city and the outlying islands. This place looks mega busy and you will definitely have to book. It's a lovely looking place with crisp white tablecloths placed on tables positioned on small terraces all over the top of the mountain. Our waiter was a lovely guy who entertained us and was totally professional- thanks for a lovely evening Mario!
The food was great overall- just a small minus from me that the Lambshank I had didn't fall apart as much as I would have liked- there wasn't anything wrong with it but could have done with another 30 mins in the pot!
But don't let this put you off, it's a special place to have a special meal and you shouldn't miss it.
I still think that the complimentary "" firewater"" that is given to us guys everywhere is an acquired taste - much preferred the one given to ladies, but I might be a bit of a whimp!

asep20,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"We visited here on our honeymoon as we'd been bought a meal here by my brother and his wife.

You take the cable car up, which for us wasn't a great experience due to the daft ticketing system/sweltering wait but this is unrelated to the restaurant itself.

We had a table booked on the edge overlooking Dubrovnik and the view really was absolutely spectacular. Tip - stay until after dark to catch the view of the city all lit up, just as impressive in its own right.

Our service from Roberto was top notch, he's certainly a character and added to the memorable nature of our stay.

Blankets were provided as the temperature turned cooler, which my wife enjoyed!

Thankfully in such a great setting the food didn't let the experience down. I had the beef tagliata (marinated for ten days apparently) and it was delicious, a lighter dish too as its essentially served with a lovely fresh salad. My wife had the beef pasta and also enjoyed her dish.

Desserts were very nice and pretty generous portions.

Bit of a mix up involving payment, as despite my brother booking and paying in advance with Anita, the restaurant had no record and we had to contact them in the UK. Thankfully this was resolved.

Given it's location the restaurant is also fairly reasonably priced.

Our food was very nice and we had a glass of Croatian sparkling wine each as the sun went down. My only complaint was that once our mains had been taken away, the waiter didn't come back, either to offer us the dessert menu OR the bill, for about half an hour. We could see him standing chatting to a table like he had no other customers to serve. Eventually I had my hand stuck right up in the air to try and get his attention and as he came to serve the table next to us and gave me what I guess he thought was a ""cheeky"" grin and said ""They were first!"", I'm afraid I finally had enough of his amateur attitude and told him quite bluntly we had waited a long time. He suddenly seemed to realise he had neglected us and did give us 10% off our bill, but it seems a shame to receive such unprofessional service in such an acclaimed restaurant.

With a soft cloud cover gently lofting over the city, the varying play of light intensity caught our eye first on one building, then another. The food was definitely good, the service was great, and the cost only slightly more expensive than might be expected if you were just going to a ""view restaurant.""

We had reserved a table early and were seated on the edge of the terrace with an unobstructed view of Dubrovnik. It did get cool when the sun set and being high there was a col wind blowing. But the restaurant brought along a portable electric heater and blankets for us. With a little forethought we should have brought warmer clothing with us. Now to the food. The food was good but the selection of deserts was remarkably uninspiring. We chose the cheese board with olives for desert which was very good. We found the cheese board in the 'Starters' section on the menu. Service was friendly and helpful. A must restaurant when in Dubrovnik but not just for the food.,,May 2017

We booked a table a couple of weeks in advance requested a spot with an uninterrupted view.

We arrived a little early and the restaurant was busy with people trying to be seated that had not booked prior, our table was already ready for us which was nice. 

The food and wine is excellent and so reasonably priced considering the location. 

The waiter dropped my wife's lasagne en route to the table which caused a delay in us receiving our food. He offered us a round of drinks to apologise which wasn't necessary but welcomed, we were just happy to be sat there taking in the breathtaking view.

Would recommend taking the cable car. As with other dubrovnik taxi experiences, we were ripped off. On this ride the meter was turned off and we were just given a price. Our rates (same route, same time of evening over 5 nights) varied widely with some fares being 70 kuna and then some as high as 120 Kuna, appears that some drivers are manipulating the meters.

The food was great - but for me the meal was about the view. We did have a short wait for desert (but was enjoying the view and changing hues on the horizon) - and Mario advised this would now be gratis. My parter also enjoyed her cocktails.

This place is actually cheaper than many other restaurants in Dubrovnik - and worked out around the same price as a higher end meal in the U.K. Come the bill, we had 10% off our meal, and also complementary traditional Croatian liquor which was a lovely touch.

Laura X,"Hawarden, Wales, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,null,"We visited here last week after going up in the cable car and we weren't disappointed. The view from here is simply stunning. We were given a table outside, close to the edge so we could really enjoy looking at the old town from above. It was a pleasant surprise to find patio heaters and fleecy blankets to wrap around you if it's chilly! 

We only wanted a coffee, and I fancied some chips, while my other half had a piece of cheese cake, but the menu certainly looked very tempting. Service was excellent and our waiter thoughtfully brought over two forks in case we wanted to share the cheesecake, and the chips were served with both mayonnaise and ketchup without me having to ask for it. 

I'm not sure how lucky you could be getting a table without a reservation during peak season; I imagine it to be totally packed. It might be worth booking ahead during the busier months, but I certainly recommend a trip up here. Another point to mention is that whilst the view over Dubrovnik is incredible, the view over the mountains behind is also worth taking time over. The Croatian War of Independence museum is also to be found up here (separate to the restaurant and you need to pay 40 Kunas to visit) and is just a short walk away from the Panorama Restaurant.

gingerhdh,"Worcester, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,We were able to get a table outside without a reservation - I am not sure we would be so lucky in peak season so that's something to think about. We both had the beef tagliata with a side of rosemary potatoes. If a little underseasoned (no problem as there were plenty of condiments on the table) it was a delicious lunch and the view made it all the better. We shared a chocolate and walnut cake for desert which was fab! All in all a lovely spot for lunch. Not cheap especially if you add in the costs of the cable car to get up there but will be a highlight meal from our trip so was worth it.,,Apr 2017

The place is wonderful, the view is phenomenal (if you catch the right table), choice of food and drink good, they cost a bit high, but it is normal for such places.
But , here's what happened to us a couple of days ago. We ordered a drink, waited 20 minutes, when the waiter came back with a request to repeat the order because they lost it ?!? OK, it happens, we repeated the order, waited for another 15 minutes, got a drink, drank it and wanted to pay and go. The waiter who served us disappeared, we asked other one to bring us the bill, brought it but did not take the money with an explanation that someone else will come. For the next 20 minutes we waited (with 3-4 requests to the waiters who were passing) and finally succeeded , but it was more than hour for one drink ? And it was not a crowd at all ...

It's easy to find, menu offers some options and the service is great. The prices are on the high side but not as crazy as other restaurants inside the wall or who claimed to be 5 stars. The cappuccino was excellent and the other food was okay. Presentation was good and again service was excellent.

The staff was just fabulous. The men wear dapper fedora style hats, and Hubby commented that he wanted one. We were astonished when Miroslav actually took off his hat and put it on Hubby's head, then told him to keep it !

Roberto was our server, and he was not only excellent, but a lot of fun. Since we didn't want much food, we ordered desserts and coffee. Hubby had apple strudel and I had three scoops of ice cream, covered in whipping cream and chocolate sauce. The dessert portions were enormous, and though everything was pricier than most of Croatia, you have to consider that Dubrovik is tourist central, and this particular restaurant is probably THE must-do restaurant in Dubrovnik.

We figured $8 USD each for dessert and $4.50 for cappuccino or latte was the price you pay for dining with such a magnificent view. Then Roberto brought our bill, which was discounted 10% - because it was the end of the season, he said. He saved us $3.

Food was a curates egg. Drinks, wine, starters were excellent. Our mains were a bit disappointing, mainly due to the quality of the meats rather than the preparation.

The cable car up to the restaurant/viewing point was very busy as it was close to sunset but once up there the views of Dubrovnik, the Old Town and surrounding areas were unbelievable especially as the sun was going down. 

We arrived at the restaurant slightly early but where told that they'd come and get us when our table was ready. 5 minutes later we were led to a table that probably offered the best view I've ever had during a meal. The waiter was more than too happy to take a great photo of the 3 of us and we were offered blankets to keep us warm as we ate (useful when you've got a 3 year old with you). 

The meal itself was just as tasty as the view and service was good too. It's a bit pricey for a meal when you include the cable car up but worth every penny when you're eating with views offered from this restaurant.

Be sure to reserve the tables by the edge (with the best unobstructed view) in advance - we walked in at 5pm and had to sit further inside (there were 3 tables and a walkway between us and the view). Despite restaurant being on multiple levels we had to walk towards the edge where other diners were in order to get an unobstructed picture of the sunset.

You can access the restaurant by the cable car but note that the last ride is at ten pm. We took a cab and the ride is not too long.

The place is definitely a must try. They do close at 11 pm in the not so touristic seasons and open later during summer. The prices are mid-range and for all that we had the total amount of the bill was not too expensive. The only comment that I would give is that they should have a nicer choice of music.

As you might expect, the cost here is paying for food and also for the incomparable view, but even so, I didn't think my meal of sandwich, soft drink, and coffee was excessively expensive.

We emailed ahead to reserve a cliff side table. When we arrived the staff were very friendly immediately and showed us to our table. The view was not quite as we expected so we asked to move to another table right on the edge with a better view in my opinion. This was no problem at all and staff handled it very well and were very professional and polite. The view is nothing but spectacular. I suggest arriving just before sunset as this is truly special. We were recommended a lovely local wine which was not cheap but very good none the less. I had the prawns buzzara and my partner had the stuffed squids. Both dishes were a decent portion and delicious. We also enjoyed the grilled vegetables cooked to perfection. Yes this restaurant is geared towards the tourist market mainly but it absolutely delivers and you get good value for your money. The setting is very romantic and makes for special evening out. Also worth noting is that you can pre book your cable car tickets to get up to the restaurant online to avoid queuing to buy tickets on the day as it can get very busy. Definitely worth doing when in Dubrovnik!,,Sep 2016

Nice and attentive staff with reasonably priced drinks and food, but the view beats all comers. Even if you aren't hungry, at least stop for a drink and try and get a table at the front to gain an amazing unobstructed view of Dubrovnok and surrounds - a photographers dream!

Amy D,null,null,5,null,null,null,null,"Panorama was the perfect choice to celebrate our wedding anniversary and I would highly recommend it!

We arrived a bit early as we weren't sure how long the cable car would take - after taking some pics and having a look around we went to check if our table might be ready early - luckily it was!

We had a front row table on the terrace at 8pm - the view of Dubrovnik and the sea tinkling below was utterly mesmerising! You couldn't ask for a more romantic setting!

I ordered Dalmatian Trio to start and my husband had beef carpaccio- both were yummy and we ended up sharing mine as it was a big portion. The octopus was tender - probably the best I've had! I then had fillet of the day which was Tuna - it was cooked perfectly and very tasty. My husband had octopus which was also cooked brilliantly. We were having a rest before picking a dessert when our waiter arrived with a lovely hazelnut dessert (on the house) with 'happy anniversary' piped on - it was such a thoughtful touch and very much appreciated! The service throughout our meal was great - just the right amount of attention and there whenever we needed (even snapping some pictures for us) whilst never being overbearing.

I booked the table at Panorama about 10 days before as I wanted to ensure to had a first row terrace table for our celebration - the restaurant came back to me quickly on email and the whole process was very easy! I'd recommend booking if you want to be sure of the best spot.

This restaurant really made our anniversary special - an unbeatable view paired with great food and service at a very reasonable price!",,Sep 2016

We visited on a Monday evening and it was almost fully booked. We were seated promptly to our table, located right on the edge with uninterrupted views of the city and Lapad. My husband and I both ordered steak and it was cooked to perfection. A little on the pricier side but not extortionate given the setting.

The location is amazing, with a wonderfull view on the old city of Dubrovnik. Me and my family had calamary and grilled chicken for lunch, and we've chosen chocolate cake with walnuts for dessert. 

The restaurant itself had a pleasant vibe, clean, with some lounge music in the background - but not too loud.

The waitress was very polite was always there when needed. After our order, the food came after about 15 minutes. Long enough to chat a little bit and appreciate the view (our sitting places were next to the glass wall).

The chicken and calamary were served with ratatouille and with a small basket with bread inside. Both were well prepared and quite delicious. 

The chocolate cake was also delisious, although maybe a little bit too sweet.

All in all, it was a very good meal, and at the end we had such a pleasant suprise, we could not believe our eyes:
Instead of paying 70 Euros total, we got a discount of 30%!!

It seems like every table has a view of the old town. The menu selection is not huge but we were very happy with our dishes. Service was first class and prices were OK for such a fantastic location.

We had originally wanted to sit outside but would have had to have been put on on a waiting list as of course lots of people wanted to sit outside.

London0Ripponden4,"Ripponden, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"We reserved an outside table at the Panorama for dinner on the last evening of our holiday in Dubrovnik, and we were so pleased we did. Booked for 7.30pm (having been told we had the table until 9.15) so we could see the sunset, but we arrived early at 7pm and were immediately seated at our table, so had plenty of time for a cocktail before ordering! I recommend booking - we lost count of the number of people who we watched being turned away, as all the outside tables were fully booked. 
We shared the burrata to start - not as described as it was a large piece of fresh mozzarella with salad leaves, cherry tomatoes and pesto dressing on two pieces of toasted ciabatta. However, it was delicious and large enough for two of us. We then had the king prawns, a side of fries and the ribeye steak, cooked as ordered and both very tasty, followed by a cheesecake for dessert and a baileys coffee, again both were spot on. The whole meal including drinks - a cosmopolitan, 2 large beers, and a bottle of the white Pinot (very nice) - came to 1082 kunas. For the quality of the food we thought this was very good - the only thing overpriced in my opinion compared to the UK was the wine and unfortunately there was no 'house' wine on offer. However, the service was excellent throughout, the atmosphere very special and the view was simply magnificent - most definitely worth a few pounds extra.

Our pals who has wine seemed please with their choices. We all order a bunch of separate things so we could all enjoy parts of every meal.

We hadn't accounted for the insects at the top of the hill and so our experience was slightly spoiled by two very persistent wasps who just would not leave us alone while we were eating.

Annett Z,"Berlin, Germany",Germany,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"Last year we tried Restaurant Nautika, so this year we had to try Panorama Restaurant. What a splendid view of Dubrovnik and surrounding! Lovely temperature on the mountain, as there is a little breeze that cools you off from the hot (but lovely) Old Town.

Normally I don't choose it for lunch, but being pregnant, I was so into red meat, that I took the ribeye steak. I asked on purpose for well-done, and to my surprise the meat was still tender! Delicious! Thinking back of the dessert, my mouth starts watering again.. 
You can choose anything, from small to big, an appetizer, a snack, lovely fish, pasta, rice, or just a nice drink, and everything has that little touch from Dubrovnik/Croatia.

Some people find it too expensive, but compared to prices in France, Holland, Luxembourg or Germany, I find it pretty equal and fair. Plus, you get to eat and taste real quality food.

The crew is super kind. You cannot leave the Panorama Restaurant without a smile. 
I would definitely come back.",,Jul 2016
jem999,"Keswick, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,null,null,null,null,"Having read some reviews we tried to book a table for 8pm and sunset but they could only accommodate us at 6.30 or 9pm. 
We went for 6.30 which was excellent as we had the table guaranteed until 8.45 and managed to see the view in daylight, watch the sunset and see the city lights come on all before leaving.
The food was great and the service very good. The staff were really friendly and helpful and we did not feel at all rushed. 
Our waiter offered to take a photo for us and has obviously had a lot of practice and made sure he got us and the town below in the shot. 
The only downside ( and the reason for not giving 5 stars) was that lots of diners who were not lucky enough to have a table on the cliff edge were walking over to tables on the edge to take photos. Not what you really want as you are eating. Ok some were subtle when doing this but others quite obtrusive. Perhaps the staff need to ask diners not to do this and direct them to the upper bar area to do this if they feel the need as there was just as good a view from up there and they would not be intruding on anyone.
All that aside, I would thoroughly recommend the experience of fining here.",,Aug 2016

We arrived a bit early and had a drink in the bar. A good selection of beer and wine. We then got our table which was one with a great view.

We heard many people ask for a table who hadn't booked and were told that all of the most scenic tables were booked in advance.

Food was good. We both had a starter which was large and then we both had steak for mains. All good was tasty and good size. Service was friendly and helpful. 

Views were outstanding. Dinner very reasonable for the whole experience. Two starters, two mains, one beer, two glasses of wine was approx $140 AUD.

pookierara,newcastle upon tyne,newcastle upon tyne,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,null,"We knew of the restaurant prior to our visit throught the internet / brochures, but nothing actually prepared us for such a wonderful experinece.

Having braved the cable car (15 people t0 each car - a little crowded) to the top of the mountain overlooking Dunbrovnik in searing heat (even at 6pm),my wfie and I asked, more in hope than anythinh else, if there were any seats available. We should have booked but took a chance anyway. They said to try again in half an hour, but I hung around looking to see who was leaving hoping for a table. The views are stunning and the sunet was truly memorable. Got some lovely photos.

Obviously we wanted one on the side of the mountian overlooking Dubrovnik, but were told they were all reserved and accepted that we may have to go for a table away from the side.

However. I saw a table that was empty and asked if it was free an would it be possible to have that. The lady looked surprised and said she would check - lo and behold it was free. RESULT.

As went towards our seat another table suddenly became free nearer the edge and she asaked if we would like that table - the answer was a resounding YES. ANOTHER RESULT. That was our first stroke of luck.

The second storke was to get probably the best waiter there....superb sense of humour, extremely helpful and eager to please. 

We ordered a couple of cocktails and beers and also selected a bottle of local Merlot for the meal. Superb wine - 14.7 in strength and absolutely spot on.

Now comes the BIG mistake. My wife said she wasn't too fussy about a starter so i suggested we share a plate of mixed cheeses and olives. The mistake was that it was HUGE and having tried our very best eventually gave in to the pressure of what the rest of the meal was going to offer and left some of the starter. Oh dear - being someone who enjoys his food, thats not something I am proud of.

My wife chose a vegetarian main course which she absolutely adored and was pleased that there was a decent selection of veggie food which is not something Croatia readily offers in abundance.

To my surprise I chose the Lamb Shank which I did not expect to see on a Dubrovnik menu. Glad I did though because it was superb - fell off the bone.

More wine and more first class service and fun with the waiter, who when we asked for the desert menu, offered us the choice of the menu with the compliments of the management. So my wife and I decided on ice creams, which sounds a bit boring, but with three dollops of varying flavours with biscuits was absolutely excellent.

Finished with another cocktail whilst looking out over probably one of the best views from a restaurant I have encountered. Absolutley superb.

The setting was great - the service was great - our waiter was great - the whole experience was GREAT. The highlight of our holiday.

It cost a bit but who cares when you can have this sort of night out with your wife.

We went up early and sat watching one of the best sunsets that you will see.
My wife and I started with Lasagne she had the one with spinach and I had the bolognese, well it was a meal on its own and was excellent.
For main I had the Grilled Beefsteak that was accompanied by pepper sauce and young potatoes with rosemary and garlic. My wife had the chefs recommendation which was duck in a balsamic glaze and both meals were of exceptional standard.
Both meals were combined with very attentive staff that were there even to take the photo of a life time at the end of the meal.

This seemed a beautiful place to finish the holiday and wow!! it was breathtaking. The views are remarkable and well worth seeing if you are able to go! We were seated in a wonderful table also with a great view and couldn't wait to spend the evening in this perfect location but unfortunately it went down hill from here..

Initial service, drinks and our starter were all very good it was going so well until our mains... We both ordered the grilled beef steak with veg. As it came out, it looked lovely and was served professionally.. I took to the steak with my knife and could honestly not even cut into it. It was hard, low quality and cold. Personally I like to eat my meal hot? My partner said his was also served warm which for a steak is not really acceptable? I kindly asked for it to be re heated or another steak cooked and our waiter apologised and took away my food saying they will make me a fresh one. Already a little annoyed as my partner had pretty much finished his meal, I was still waiting on mine. It finally came and it was the exact same steak that was taken away before only cooked more (far too over cooked really..) this time a little warmer but STILL not as hot as it should have been?! I am not really a fussy person when eating out but to me, food being served hot is essential. I then realised my veg had been taken off and never came back so I was left with just a lump of very over cooked meat. I was rather disappointed and tried to attract attention but this proved difficult. In the end I had another cold plate and several wasps all helping themselves to my food. I was furious considering the prices they charge here are not cheap, I really was expecting better. I had to leave my own table to find attention and eventually was spoken to. I explained the situation and we were given sincere apologies and our bill on the house however for us it did just ruin the experience and by then we did just stand up and leave. To be fair to the management they tried to organise anything we wanted to compensate us through another meal or anything of our choice, but we chose to call a taxi and leave. Kindly they paid for the taxi bill which we appreciated but overall we were sad that it was such a let down. I would suggest going here for a drink and not a meal!!",,Jul 2016

Eve B,"Barnoldswick, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,4,3.0,4.0,5.0,null,"We walked up Mount Srd and a stop at the Panorma Restaurant for refreshments was very welcome, and a good respite from the rain which had just begun. The cable car wasn't running because of a storm the previous night, so the restaurant was quiet and we were lucky enough to secure a table in front of the huge glass windows giving a stunning panoramic view of Dubrovnik below, and out to the islands beyond.
We had drinks and a large slice of chocolate and walnut cake which was beautifully presented. It wasn't cheap but then I guess you pay for the view, which was well worth it. I imagine on days when the cable car is running and in the height of summer it could get very busy so maybe book in advance if you know you definitely want to eat here - the main meals I saw being served to other tables looked very good.",,Jun 2016

SuviML,"Helsinki, Finland",Finland,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,null,"Our table was not right on the edge, but we could still admire the blue sea and enjoy the views. For lunch we took a tuna salad and a seafood plate. Both were very good. The tuna salad was not that original, but no complaints. The seafood plate however was delicious, and had a great freshness to it. Also amazing iced coffees for dessert. Service was very good, they were able to find us a table very fast even though the place was full.",,Jul 2016

kellywestra,null,null,5,null,null,null,null,"We took the cable car to the top and decided to stop by for a drink. Cocktails were large and tasty, but a bit pricey. However, considering the prime location of the restaurant we understood the price tag and deemed it worthy.

As we were getting a bit peckish we shared a beef sandwich, which was really delicious. The staff were very friendly and attentive, which made the experience very pleasant. I can definitely recommend this amazing site for everyone who is visiting Dubrovnik.",,Jul 2016
Yvonne016,"Greater London, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"This restaurant has not only the most breathtakingly beautiful view in the world, genuinely but the food was surprisingly excellent considering it's a tourist spot. It's just so romantic,carved out of lots of terraces on different levels seated under umbrellas which are all different heights it's truly enchanting with a tiny matchbox Dubrovnik below and the islands scattered to your right where you watch the sunset go down and the moonlight rise up and twinkle on the sea. Rarely can I remember ever seeing a view as incredible as this. If there is nothing else you do in Dubrovnik come here. The food wasn't even that expensive. We had the chefs special which was duck with hazelnuts in a caramel sauce. Quite heavenly. My husband had a cheese platter to start followed by lamb shank which was delicious. I had carpaccio as a starter which was too salty and the prawns in a tomato sauce which was ok. We did love it which is why we returned the next evening. And if you choose your food wisely you will have a superb time. Mario our waiter was outstanding!",,Jul 2016
54JCL,"Northern Ireland, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,3,2.0,3.0,2.0,null,"This restaurant is in a superb location at the top of the cable car station. Amazing views over Dubrovnik Old Town and the beautiful coastline. We arrived around 6.30pm but were told that all the tables with the best views of the city were booked. We took a table several rows back with views of the mountains which was still stunning.
Food was very poor quality. The burgers were raw in the middle and when asked if everything was okay, we replied that we were unable to eat our meals as they were undercooked. The waiter apologised, gave us our bill and we were charged the full price.
This was our only poor meal during our week in the Dubrovnik area. There are so many good restaurants to choose from but Panorama Restaurant is one that I will definitely not be recommending.",,Jun 2016

ALAN C,"Bedford, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,5,null,null,null,null,"We visited the Panorama Restaurant for our last evening in the city. We had high expectations after the staff in our hotel recommended it. We booked two days prior, as this was also recommended. You get the choice of two hour sittings, 19.00 & 21.00, but we did not feel rushed. I took a recommendation from our waiter Marijo, who was fantastic, as we all members of the staff that met. This is a must eat in restaurant, so book as soon as you arrive in town. Also use the cable car up and down. The journey is 60 seconds, but the views are stunning, as they are from the top. We had table 44, which was just the best.",,Jul 2016

Zoë H,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,2,null,null,null,null,"Me and my partner booked a table for 2 here to finish off our fabulous week in Croatia.. This seemed a beautiful place to finish the holiday and wow!! it was breathtaking. The views are remarkable and well worth seeing if you are able to go! We were seated in a wonderful table also with a great view and couldn't wait to spend the evening in this perfect location but unfortunately it went down hill from here..

Initial service, drinks and our starter were all very good it was going so well until our mains... We both ordered the grilled beef steak with veg. As it came out, it looked lovely and was served professionally.. I took to the steak with my knife and could honestly not even cut into it. It was hard, low quality and cold. Personally I like to eat my meal hot? My partner said his was also served warm which for a steak is not really acceptable? I kindly asked for it to be re heated or another steak cooked and our waiter apologised and took away my food saying they will make me a fresh one. Already a little annoyed as my partner had pretty much finished his meal, I was still waiting on mine. It finally came and it was the exact same steak that was taken away before only cooked more (far too over cooked really..) this time a little warmer but STILL not as hot as it should have been?! I am not really a fussy person when eating out but to me, food being served hot is essential. I then realised my veg had been taken off and never came back so I was left with just a lump of very over cooked meat. I was rather disappointed and tried to attract attention but this proved difficult. In the end I had another cold plate and several wasps all helping themselves to my food. I was furious considering the prices they charge here are not cheap, I really was expecting better. I had to leave my own table to find attention and eventually was spoken to. I explained the situation and we were given sincere apologies and our bill on the house however for us it did just ruin the experience and by then we did just stand up and leave.
