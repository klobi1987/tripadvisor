✅ Featured on TripAdvisor Asia
✅ Japanese tour group menus

**Santorini Restaurants**:
✅ Instagram-focused (Korean market success)
✅ Photo-worthy settings emphasized
✅ Asian influencer collaborations

### 8.2 Dubrovnik Competitive Landscape - Japanese Market

**Current Status**:
❌ **NO Dubrovnik restaurants targeting Japanese market specifically**
❌ **NO Japanese platform presence (any restaurant)**
❌ **LIMITED Japanese-language materials**
❌ **NO tour operator partnerships visible**

**This means**:
🏆 **FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE AVAILABLE**

**Why Now?**:
1. Croatia-Japan tourism promotion active (2024)
2. JTB, HIS, Hankyu already engaged with Croatia
3. Japanese tourist numbers growing (5% increase)
4. Competition hasn't moved yet
5. Turkish Airlines partnership in place (connectivity)

**Window of Opportunity**:
⏰ **12-18 months** before competitors catch on
- Tour operators booking 8-12 months ahead
- First to partner = preferred restaurant status
- Build reputation in Japanese market early

## 11. RISK ANALYSIS

### 11.1 Market Risks

**LOW RISKS** ✅:
- Japanese tourism to Croatia growing (5% increase confirmed)
- Croatia Tourism Board actively promoting in Japan
- Tour operator interest confirmed (JTB partnership exists)
- Japanese tourist spending high (premium segment)

**MEDIUM RISKS** ⚠️:
- Currency fluctuation (Yen weakness could impact)
- Japanese economic uncertainty
- Competition catches on (first-mover advantage lost)
- Service quality inconsistency (Japanese very critical)

**HIGH RISKS** 🔴:
- Tabelog listing may not be possible (foreign restaurants)
- ROI timeline longer than expected (18-24 months)
- Tour operator partnerships difficult to establish
- Japanese tourists seasonal (summer focus)

### 11.2 Operational Risks

**Service Quality** 🔴:
- Current Japanese service rating: 4.0 (below expectations)
- Risk: Negative word-of-mouth if service disappoints
- Mitigation: Staff training BEFORE marketing investment

**Language Barrier** ⚠️:
- Japanese guests may have limited English
- Risk: Communication issues, order mistakes
- Mitigation: Photo menu, basic Japanese phrases training

**Cultural Misunderstanding** ⚠️:
- Western service style may seem too casual
- Risk: Japanese guests feel uncomfortable
- Mitigation: Cultural training, formal service option

**Booking Management** ⚠️:
- Japanese tourists book far in advance (39-58 days)
- Risk: Inventory management for tour groups
- Mitigation: Reservation system upgrade, group allocation

### 11.3 Mitigation Strategies

**Risk Mitigation Plan**:

1. **Phase Investment**: Start with Phase 1 (3,000€), evaluate before Phase 2
2. **Service Training First**: Fix service rating before marketing
3. **Tour Operator Focus**: B2B (93% of market) lower risk than B2C
4. **Croatian Tourism Alignment**: Leverage national-level promotion
5. **Start Small**: Test with 2-3 influencers before full campaign
6. **Measure Continuously**: Track Japanese guest numbers monthly

**Go/No-Go Decision Points**:
- After 6 months: Has Japanese guest count increased 50%? (Yes = continue)
- After 12 months: Tour operator partnerships secured? (Yes = expand)
- After 18 months: ROI ≥2x achieved? (Yes = maintain, No = reassess)
